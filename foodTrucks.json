            "short_description": "Pittsburgh is a blue collar town built on the hard labor of steel workers. When the Great  hit, they had to work even longer hours just to make ends meet.  With twenty hour work days and only twenty minute lunch breaks, the workers needed a delicious and filling meal before going back to work, but lacked the time to sit down and eat a full meal of protein, vegetables, and potatoes. Out of this desire, the Pittsburgh-style sandwich was born. \r\n\r\nThe sandwich shops started serving slaw and fries on the sandwich. This way the steel workers could have a quick, tasty, satisfying meal to get them through the rest of their shift.  Still to this day Pittsburgh sandwiches are made this way and are a staple of the Pittsburgh community. \r\n\r\nWhy are Steel City Sandwiches so yummy? They're comfort food. There's no fancy mayo, buttered buns, or truffle oil. They don't need 'em! Fresh ingredients prepared properly taste great all on their own. We get our Italian bread fresh daily from Vito at Eagle Rock Bakery. \r\nWe don't toast 'em or butter 'em cause they're fresh and perfect for holding overloaded sandwiches. \r\nThe coleslaw is shredded daily and wilted with sugar and vinegar for over an hour to get that perfect vinegary slaw taste. \r\nThe fries are hand cut, blanched to get that starchy taste out, and then cooked again at a higher temperature to get that perfect crispiness. Just a little salt and pepper and those fries are good to go. Three simple ingredients treated properly are the foundation for the perfect Steel City Sandwich.",

While the benefits of juicing are endless, we aim to cut through the confusion and condescension of so many health trends and get to the point: our bodies require vital nutrients to function at their optimal levels, and the quickest and most natural way to get them is through fresh juice. While that is not a revolutionary concept, it seems that with every step we’ve taken towards making the world more connected, we have some how lost sight of the basics. \r\n\r\nAt PRESSED, we want you to have it all. Our juices are made with organic ingredients and are pressed daily, and personalized to your lifestyle, providing you with the option to hop online and order individual bottles or a cleanse, straight to your doorstep as often as you’d like. Life gets complicated, but at the end of the day all of your goals are possible if you have a finely-tuned vehicle to help you accomplish them. So, let us do the work, while you enjoy the ride.",

Founder Carrie Cohen first conceived of the idea during a brief stint as an entertainment industry assistant when she realized that her favorite part of the job was bringing in homemade treats for her coworkers. Made with all organic dairy and humanely harvested cage-free eggs, our pudding is hand whisked to rich and creamy perfection in small batches, utilizing the best ingredients we can find. All of our pudding is naturally gluten-free, and seasonal vegan options are a constant presence on the rotating menu. We look forward to seeing you at your upcoming events and on the streets!",

            "short_description": "Mandoline Grill started with the simple promise to bring delicious Vietnamese food to Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nOwner, Mong Skillman, incorporates both traditional and vegan options into the menu. The flavor and family history is passed down through her mother's tasty recipes, who also owns and operates Sông Hương restaurant in Honolulu, Hawaii.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 2009, Mandoline Grill launched at the Verdugo Bar in Glassell Park. For these first few months, Mong supplied her own fryers, toaster oven, and coolers, basically throwing a backyard cookout at the beloved Eastside bar. As support grew, Mong started riding shotgun and working shifts on the Dosa Truck, just to get a hang of the food truck life before hitting the streets in her own truck this past February 2010.\r\n\r\nNow Mong has the privilege of introducing her mother’s inspirational flavors to LA (and beyond!) as she drives the Mandoline Grill truck from Orange County to Echo Park to Santa Monica, offering fresh, crisp vegan and carnivore-friendly bánh mì sandwiches, and of course, her mother’s famous bún thịt nướng noodle bowls.\r\n\r\nWe are pleased to offer you a taste of Vietnam with a splash of Aloha!",

            "short_description": "Waffles de Liege separates itself from most other Liege waffle eateries in that all of their dough is freshly made from scratch each morning.  You would be hard pressed to find any pre-made waffle dough in our truck.  The recipe we use is the culmination of weeks of testing and research, making sure the taste and texture is authentically Belgian. The extra work required to achieve this was never regarded as an inconvenience. Our company culture revolves around passion for the food and a dedication to providing our customers with only the best of the best. We feel that there really is no other way to serve Liege waffles than to make them fresh, prepare them fresh, and serve them fresh.\r\n\r\nA Taste of Liege in SoCal\r\n\r\nOriginally created in the 18th century in Liege, Belgium, the Liege waffle is one of two types of “Belgian” waffles, the other type being the Brussels waffle. In the states, Brussels waffles are much more widely served and known and can be found anywhere from chain eateries to more upscale establishments. As a matter of fact, Brussels waffles are so commonplace nowadays that they are almost synonymous with the name Belgian waffles, a broad description originally reserved  both Liege and Brussels waffle types. Those who are familiar with Liege waffles know so because they have either traveled to Europe (where Liege waffles are much more popular) or are avid dessert foodies who actively seek out unique food items and/or look to recreate such items.\r\n\r\nRead more about this great truck on Roaming Hunger's blog, here: http://roaminghunger.com/blog/4615/waffles-de-yum",

We believe that the lighter our carbon footprint the better our world. We also believe that the love and care put into food develops more flavor and the good energy is felt by the body. \r\n\r\nWe are taking farm to table to a whole new level with our \"healthy junk food\" or \"comfort food with conscience\". We are serving up Kobe beef burgers made with Tillimook white cheddar on locally made fresh brioche and in house made garlic aioli. We are using free range chicken wings and drums for our diablo & angel wings. Our Ribs come from happy pigs and 90% of our food is organic. It's all the flavor and half the guilt. Because at least you know you are supporting sustainable, free range, organic & local. ",

Rich in nutrients and fibers, these delicious rolls are served alongside a dipping sauce, another important characteristic of Vietnamese food.\r\n\r\nFor us, ăn nam represents a linkage between the old and the new. Having been raised on traditional Vietnamese cooking in Hue, Central Vietnam, and then growing up in Southern California, the owner at ăn nam would like to preserve, and share the unique tastes of his childhood experiences along with fusion inspired techniques of modern cooking.",

Once I discovered the great Southern California winters there was no way I could return to the wicked cold winters of New England. The one HUGE sacrifice I was forced to make was the delicious seafood that can only be found in the ocean waters off the New England coast (GREAT LOBSTER). For many years I would have Maine Lobsters and New England clam chowder shipped to me by my family so that I could share that unique taste with all my wonderful friends and family here in Southern California. In 2008 after both of our children had graduated college, my lovely Southern California born wife and I decided to return to the coast of Massachusetts and enjoy the so called golden years, but they were still very cold winters (and a little boring) missing friends and family we decided to return and bring along with us that Great seafood we had been missing. Here enters ROLLN LOBSTER!!!!! Rolln Lobster is a Gourmet Food Truck which offers a wonderful sampling of East Coast goodies. We feature only fresh Maine Lobster (never frozen) in our Lobster Rolls, Lobster Sliders, and Lobster Louie along with great clam chowder and lobster bisque. We love to meet other transplants from the east coast and if you happen to be one of the few people who have not tried the Best the East Coast has to offer then come on by for a free sample on us. We look forward to serving you with a great New England welcome and some of the best food you’ve ever tasted.",

Albert finished Culinary School and decided to try and offer something that he felt wasn't already on the table for food culture. Belly Bombz was first started at farmers markets then eventually grew out further. Belly Bombz mixes different asian inspired flavors with the oh so popular wings. We thought why not fuse chicken wings with other flavors that your traditional wing spot would offer. By popular demand we decided to venture into the food truck craze allowing us to go to different locations. Now that you know a little about us, come see what we're talking about!",

            "short_description": "Who are the faces behind Good Greek Grub? Dino Pantazis and Vasilis \"Billy\" Petrou. We both had an idea to bring our knowledge of cooking, the restaurant business and the love of eating Greek food to the people of Los Angeles. Our Gyros are the Souvlaki Gyros (Shish Kabob Gyros) you'd find in Greece. We refused to serve our customers mystery meat shaped into a cone . After many attempts at different recipes and many many Gyros eaten in Greece (we did it for the people) we came up with flavors that are mouth watering good. The pork souvlaki is our speciality. Not to say the rest of the food isn't as delicious but it's the one we're most proud of..... Our \"claim to fame.\" We hope all of our FB friends have a chance to try our food and find out for themselves. \r\n\r\nAnd don't forget to try out Saganaki Bites! Created by us and sold only on the G3 truck!\r\n\r\nThanks for supporting us and see you around!",

            "short_description": "A Coolhaus is many things. It is an architecturally inspired ice cream sandwich. The Coolhaus consists of all-natural handmade ice creams of classic and seasonal varieties or custom-made to suit your needs, packed between two cookies of your choice. The Coolhaus is set in your hands in an edible wrapper custom-printed upon with edible ink to commemorate a place, person or event. \r\n\r\nA Coolhaus is also an ice cream sandwich food truck; a converted postal van with chrome rims (or Rem's), a pink top, and a fold-down bar and table. The Coolhaus truck is happily driven by architects, designers, developers, artists, bakers, actors, writers, musicians and people from other walks of life. \r\n\r\nA Coolhaus is also a thinker, a thinker about reclaiming public and urban space for eating and gathering, when and where it is least expected, or when it is invited to share its decadent treats with interested eaters. A Coolhaus is an innovator about how to reinvent or redesign food with epicurian sensibility but also with a search for sustainability and minimal waste. A Coolhaus is passionate about food, where it comes from, how it is made, and how it is given to the eater. A Coolhaus has a curiosity for the day-to-day gastro-experience and a devotion to the public for social merriment.\r\n\r\n\"You can’t build a house without a blueprint and you can’t build a food truck without a great idea. Natasha and Freya are the famous founders of “farchitecture” (food + architecture). All of their ice cream sandwiches are designed to resemble a deconstructed house: a cookie roof and floor slab with ice cream walls. It may sound a little farfetched, but anything goes when the food is this good.\" To read more about Coolhaus, check out our blog here:\r\n\r\nhttp://roaminghunger.com/blog/3677/americas-coolest-haus\r\n\r\nhttp://roaminghunger.com/blog/4388/food-for-thought-coolhaus",

            "short_description": "Officially known as the \"Kogi Beef Truck\" or \"Kogi Korean BBQ Truck\", most people just know the Kogi BBQ Truck as \"delicious.\"\r\n\r\nThe street food king that pulled the sword right out of the stone. You haven't had a taste of Los Angeles until you've tried a Kogi BBQ creation. \r\n\r\nBorn from late-night hunger by founders Mark Manguera, Caroline Shin-Manguera and Chef Roy Choi, the Kogi truck is a traveling Los Angeles landmark that serves up Korean Mexican tacos, day and night.\r\n\r\nSpicy Pork Tacos, Kimchi Quesadillas and Short Rib Sliders satiate the hungry mouths of Angelenos who crave excellent food on a dime budget.  Quality Korean barbecue meets traditional, homemade tortillas and fresh veggies to create a taste that carries the rhythms of LA street culture and exudes the warmth of all that California sun.  Under the direction of Chef Roy Choi, Kogi has developed a menu that delivers high-end food at street level prices. We look forward to seeing you on the streets!\r\n",

Not willing to skimp on flavor and a sense of experience, our Foodies will have an opportunity to enjoy the best of everything at a fraction of the price.\r\n\r\nEach dog on the menu presents a sophisticated variation of traditional favorites with an innovative spin. Artful in presentation, the soulful flavors elicit a sense of nostalgia as you bite into the best dog of your life. A side of crispy tater tots becomes the ultimate accoutrement. Soy dogs are an available option for veggie lovers!\r\n\r\nMUST TRY: \r\nSpicy Algeleno - Bacon wrapped all beef dog topped with salsa fresca, tomatillo sauce and fried jalapenos. \r\n\r\nTo read about the experience of serving on this truck, and why food truck operators are just about the hardest workers there are, check out the blog post on Roaming Hunger here: http://roaminghunger.com/blog/4471/its-a-dog-eat-dog-world",

            "short_description": "The Urban Oven is a mobile wood fired artisan pizza truck. Authentic delicious Napoletana pizzas made from our one of a kind wood fired oven food truck. Serving on the streets of L.A. and available for private events.\r\n\r\nLIVING A FEW BLOCKS AWAY from one of the greatest pizzerias in the world can have a lasting effect on some people. Such is the case for Scott Tremonti who spent decades near the world renowned Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix, AZ. That experience lit a fire in his belly that just couldn't be put out (pun intended). He began his lifelong quest to create his own authentic Neapolitan style wood fired artisan pizza, and after years of experience and training by some of today's best pizzaiolos, Scott is ready to share his authentic artisan pizzas with the people of Los Angeles. Through his custom built mobile food truck with an actual wood fired oven, he makes each pizza fresh as it's ordered.",

Spirited, defined cuisine; and so very chic!\" describes Sky’s fare created for our customers 18 years ago.\r\n\r\nBarbara Burrell, the creator of Sky’s Gourmet Tacos, was inspired with a clear purpose and vision to become a restaurateur. The vision was solidified one morning when she was awakened with a specific theme for the restaurant, in a word…tacos! And since 1992, we have incurred great success satisfying the palates of our customers through fresh seafood and meats prepared in fine spices at our inaugural Los Angeles location, 5408 West Pico Boulevard, Los Angeles, 90019.  \r\n\r\nThe Sky’s™ Mission:\r\nSky’s™ Gourmet Tacos offers the finest quality Mexican food, with a splash of soul, to communities throughout Southern California, to the delight of our customers.\r\n\r\nOur customers have nominated the Shrimp Taco as our signature dish.  Throw in some freshly made Guacamole, Chips and Pico De Gallo and you can sense the mental “do not disturb sign” has gone up at table 3!  Then, wash it down with our own Sorrel Lemonade™ , but be sure to save a little room for some of our Homemade Cheesecake, Caramel Crunch, Mango, Pineapple and of course, Plain.\r\n\r\nOther customer favorites include: Filet Mignon, Lobster, Mahi-Mahi, Salmon and Tilapia Tacos, Specialty Salads and our Chicken and Shrimp Tortas.  And, we have a full Vegan/Vegetarian Menu.  Ask about our extensive Catering Menu which goes far beyond tacos.",

            "short_description": "Let's be Frank was founded by Sue Moore and Larry Bain, fast-food visionaries who started the company in 2005 with the simple goal of changing the world one hot dog at a time. Sue, formerly the \"meat forager\" for Berkeley, CA's famed Chez Panisse, and Larry, longtime restaurant professional, member of the San Francisco Sustainable Food Systems team, and advocate of the benefits of local, healthy foods, joined forces to return the much-demeaned hot dog to its rightful position: an icon for a healthy food system. Their goal was that their frank would become a way to nourish both eaters and growers. Let's be Frank supports the ever-shrinking group of family farmers and ranchers committed to raising their animals in a humane, conscientious, and healthy manner and in so creates dogs gone good.\r\nIt took over 18 months of tinkering with our third-generation sausage makers to perfect the recipe for our dogs. Once we did, our fist cart (opened in June 2005 outside San Francisco's Giants ballpark), quickly commanded crowds, lured by the smell of onions sizzling on the grill. We soon added a second cart outside the Warming Hut at Crissy Field near the Golden Gate Bridge.\r\n\r\nKnowing that no town is as passionate about its dogs as Los Angeles, Sue and Larry expanded to Culver City in the fall of 2007. Our big red truck, frequently seen hot-dogging around the streets of Silverlake and Culver City, was inaugurated in the spring of 2008.\r\n\r\nThe success of the business in both San Francisco and Los Angeles, as well as an ever-increasing array of fans (and product ideas!) led us to open a small shop in San Francisco in May of 2009. The shop serves up both prepared dogs with a variety of homemade toppings and sides, packaged goods including \"Party Packs\" (everything you need to throw a complete Frank Fest at home or on the go), and .\r\n\r\nThroughout the years since Frank's birth, we've continued to work on new products which support our mission of creating delicious food that delights our fans and support the work of local, family-owned farms and ranches. From our family-farmed pork bratwurst and spicy \"hot\" dog to our signature Devil Sauce (a diabolically delicious spicy topping), our products reflect our commitment to ensuring that Let's be Frank is really the home of dogs gone good.",

            "short_description": "Takoyaki!? What!?\r\n\r\nWhat the heck is “Takoyaki”???\r\nOsaka!! Without any exaggeration you could probably say, Takoyaki = Osaka and vice versa.  Takoyaki was originated from the streets of Osaka way back in it’s days.  The round shaped shells are made from eggs and flour and on the inside there are octopus pieces and a mix of veggies.  We use a special grill to cook “Takoyaki”, specially made for it.\r\n\r\nIn the old school days in Osaka they use to say if you are a newly wedded wife to a family, better bring your Takoyaki grill.  People in Japan, especially in Osaka love Takoyaki.\r\n\r\nMission Statement of Tanota\r\n\r\nOur goal is to introduce this fabulous tradition food of Osaka called the “Takoyaki” to the people outside of Japan.  We want everyone from all over the world to actually eat and experience how awesome this “Takoyaki” thing is and spread the word to the world.  It ain’t easy introducing something new to the world but look at “Sushi” now!  People thought it was the most disgusting food in the world when it was first starting to spread, \r\nShouldn’t be harder than Sushi because it’s cooked!\r\n\r\nAnyways…..\r\nAt Tanota our Takoyaki shell is based from a traditional egg and flour base but with a little bit of original touch to it.  We add a secret chicken base soup to the base which makes our Takoyaki even better.  At the end when the Takoyaki is cooked the shell will have a puffy kind of feel but on the inside it’ll have a melty soft kind of feel to it.  Be careful because the melty soft inside can be very hot!\r\n\r\nThe ingredients of our Takoyaki are………\r\nOctopus, Green Onions, Ginger, Tempura pieces.\r\n\r\nThey are topped with…….\r\nOur special Tanota Original sauce, Mayo, Dried Seaweed, and some more Green Onions.\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy and spread the love!!",

Everything down to the special sauce ingredients is imported from Greece.\r\n\r\nThe recipes that have been passed down from generations from Grandmothers to daughters to sons, have been built up for over 70 years.\r\n\r\n\"Greek specialties are created for the people, as if they are coming into our home\" stated Chef and son, Dimitri, \"The Mavropoulos family feels privileged of fulfilling a taste of happiness to the people, and we will continue to share our heritage with authentic meals along the road.\"\r\n\r\n\"We sincerely thank you for your support of our food, our mission and our recipes\"\r\n\r\nHarry & Eleni\r\nDimitri & Ruth",

With the lobster shacks in Maine similar to the taco shacks in LA, it seemed like the perfect fit. We proceeded to find a supplier that could deliver us fresh lobster and worked on developing our own lobster rolls. We tried a few types of bread, as we couldn't find the traditional split top New England rolls in LA, but it just wasn't right. As a result, like the lobster, we get our bread fresh from New England. We couldn't just have lobster rolls as our only menu item, so we decided to also add crab rolls, New England clam chowder, Cape Cod chips, and fresh squeezed lemonade. With all the pieces in place, we were ready to roll!",

Though others might just start a cheesesteak food truck, like South Philly Experience.\r\n\r\nJust getting rolling, SPE is a new sandwich food truck dedicated to replicating the street food flavors of the region that bears its name, run by recently-transplanted cousins who worked together in an Italian restaurant back home, yet somehow managed to actually move out of their mothers' houses anyways. Illadelphness starts with sandwiches like traditional cheesesteak with or w/o onions plus provolone, American, or wiz; chicken cutlet w/ spinach, broccoli rabe, or roasted peppers; roasted pork w/ cheese or greens; and meatball and chicken parm subs; all are served on classic rolls imported from the Philly bakery Amoroso, a process that everyone agrees was a total bitch. Sides include fresh cut fries, meatballs, peppers, spinach, and rabe, as well as three varieties of the hard-to-find TastyKakes: the chocolate-covered Peanut Butter Kandy Kake, moist Butterscotch Krimpets, and straight-up chocolate cupcakes, which spend their downtime depressed that they're not loved enough to misspell.\r\n\r\n",

The truck offers a variety of dishes and craft specialty drinks that are chef-inspired, innovative yet casual and fun. The menu includes original Japanese fusion hot dogs, signature hoagies, and vegan/gluten-free choices. In June 2014, Tokyo Doggie Style was named in the exclusive CBS Los Angeles’ ranking series, “Best of LA”, as one of “The Best Food Trucks in Los Angeles”. CBS LA recognized TDS for its “delicious and interesting” menu and friendly service.\r\nIn November 2014, Tokyo Doggie Style will be featured in travel cookbook, \"Food Truck Road Trip—A Cookbook\" (by Kim Pham,\r\nPhilip Shen and Terri Phillips) . The book will introduce recipes for two TDS signature hot dogs -- “100% Homie Veggie Dog” (made-from-scratch vegetarian) and the “Bacon Wrapped Hawaiian Terrier-ki dog” (a best-seller!).\r\nTokyo Doggie Style takes pride in quality food and sincere, Japanese-style hospitality. Our mission is to bring our favorite flavors and friendly service directly to you!\r\n",

We take the traditional shave ice process and turn it upside down. By pre-flavoring our ice blocks before we shave them, we are able to create whole ribbon-like sheets of Fluff Ice that is not only light in texture but amazing in taste.\r\n \r\nWe are constantly rotating our menu on the truck with the menu at our store in Monterey Park, CA. Look for us at your local food truck event, farmer’s market, or community event!\r\n\r\nTo learn about the creation of the truck, why it's always good to have friends in the food truck community, and what Fluff Ice means when they say \"edible plastic,\" read Roaming Hunger's blog here: http://roaminghunger.com/blog/4581/what-the-fluff",

The young Romolo worked in many restaurants in the Bavarian area, and for several years, including at “Il Grappolo, & La Vecchia Masseria” two of the most famous “Italian Restaurants” in Munich. He may be from the south of Italy, but his style of cooking involves the cuisine of different regions of Italy.\r\n\r\nHe came to California in 2004 and his vision is to keep the cuisine simple and fresh, using Italian and local ingredients. He truly believes everything tastes better if you cook with enthusiasm, passion, and love. In addition, he thinks sharing good recipes at our tables, is crucial to leading a fulfilling life.\r\n\r\nAfter working on many culinary events with Chef Sebastiano Sposito over the past five years, now he is ready to his newest venture, Romolo’s Italian Cuisine in January 2012, where he will serve best Italian and domestic signature dishes at fairly low prices.",

Watch out for us as we start Crepe'n Around serving crepey street food.\r\n\r\nWho knew…when sisters Eileen and Joann DeLeoz were eating their crepes right under the Eiffel Tower back in 2006, that it was the beginning of their Crepe’n Around adventure.\r\n\r\nBut if you ask their parents, Alan and Josefa, they’d probably say growing up Filipino-American—the huge family gatherings and the endless days and nights cooking in the kitchen—that drove Eileen and Joann to Crepe’n Around.\r\n\r\nFast forward to 2010, Crepe’n Around offers foodies anything from the sweet crepes we all love—Strawberries and Cream, Banana Nutella, and S’more, to savory crepes filled with Teriyaki Flank Steak, Ham & Brie, Maple Braised Pork and Chicken Pesto.\r\n\r\nNo matter what your palette, Crepe’n Around brings high-quality crepes at street level prices for everyone to enjoy.\r\n\r\nABOUT EILEEN DeLEOZ\r\nEarning her Diplôme de Pâtisserie from Le Cordon Bleu Paris, Eileen brings her experience and the traditions from the world-renowned kitchens of France to the streets of Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nBefore living, breathing and cooking all things French, Eileen earned her AOS in Culinary Arts from the California Culinary Academy in San Francisco, California.\r\n\r\nWhile formal culinary training and education has certainly built a solid foundation for her culinary career, there’s nothing that compares to her hands-on, in-your-face, kitchen hell (pun intended!) experience working at the Michelin, starring Gordon Ramsay in West Hollywood, California, and Patina at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Downtown Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nABOUT JOANN DeLEOZ\r\nWith a background in broadcast communications and marketing, Joann tends to the administration, media relations and special event responsibilities of Crepe’n Around.",

            "short_description": "I am Smokin' Willie. The new Smokin' Willie's Gourmet BBQ Truck has just come out to bring you \"BBQ Sauce so good it's unethical\"\r\n\r\nIt all began with Mom in 1967. We lived in Lake View Terrace, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. It was early on a Saturday morning (we do not remember the exact date) that an old pick-up truck with a homemade fifty-five gallon barrel BBQ on a trailer pulled up across the street for a family reunion. They started the BBQ on the driveway, and a couple of hours later the smell of this amazing BBQ was blowing in the direction of our house and driving us all crazy. My Mom invited herself to the family reunion and came back raving about the BBQ and the sauce that they used. Mom tried to get the recipe for the BBQ Sauce but was not able to finagle the recipe out of them.\r\n\r\nFinally, after what seemed like years of intense begging and maybe some threats, desperate people do crazy things, Mom got a list of some of the ingredients on a paper napkin. She practically ran home to make the first batch of sauce and was very disappointed. The sauce turned out bland and was definitely not the sauce she had tasted before. Mom was on a quest to make this sauce work so she started doing research on BBQ Sauce recipes from different parts of the country-- adding this, taking away that, more of this and less of that.\r\n\r\nMom made many batches of BBQ sauce, each improving over the previous batch. In 1969 when we landed a man on the moon, we had a neighborhood BBQ and Mom’s sauce was a hit. Smokin’ Willie’s BBQ Sauce was established.\r\n\r\nMom started canning the sauce in mason jars and the demand grew. In the early 1990’s she was making sauce and selling it to help sponsor my brother Brian’s race car. Mom has been a stock car race fan for as long as I can remember, and she is Brian’s #1 fan to this day.\r\n\r\nI worked for Warner Bros. Records and had the best job in the world! As the music industry became more corporate, money became more important than the quality of the music and I started looking into other endeavors for the future. The demand for Mom’s sauce was increasing and I began to help her make larger batches. One day Mom said that she wished she could share “the best BBQ sauce” with more people. So in 1999 I started Wild Bill’s Foods to try and market Mom’s Sauce. After a few tries, none very successful, I shelved the BBQ Sauce idea to make a living in the banking industry, but I was missing the sauce and Mom was missing me!\r\n\r\nBored by the financial world but having socked away some cash, on February 22, 2005, Smokin’ Willie’s was reborn. Chef Michael Acuna was brought on board and with his amazing talent turned Mom’s recipe into a manufacturing formula. When we brought Mom to the manufacturing plant for the first run, she tasted the sauce and with a tear in her eye she said “You did it, now I don’t have to cook the sauce for six hours anymore.” And with Mom’s blessing, we were off and running\r\n\r\nBill “Smokin Willie” Kelley is the go-to guy if you want to know about grillin’. He’s been tending the coals for over 3 decades and teaches classes, privately and in groups. He also does cooking demos at Whole Foods Markets, Home Shows, and Fancy Food Shows—almost anyplace where people are enthusiastic about delicious food. A lifelong grillin’ enthusiast, Bill made his passion his profession when he started Wild Bill’s Foods in 2005. He has built a successful company on the foundation of his mom’s spectacular barbecue sauce and his own love of grillin’. His thoughts, secrets, tips and recipes are in his new signature book, Smokin’ Willie’s Guide to Great Grillin’. Bill lives in the Los Angeles area with Diana, his wife of 28 years, and their two sons, Matt & Nick, who wouldn’t miss a family barbecue for anything.",

Each wiener is crafted under her own label for Angie per her recipes from free range beef, chicken, and pork, including a vegetarian option for those who prefer. Placed on a hot steamy bun, topped with an inventive array of the finest ingredients, each bite brings out of this world flavor!\r\n\r\nOn top it all off each order is served with a giggle and a smile by Angie and/or one of her gorgeous wiener babes.\r\n\r\nThis amazing combination of steamy goodness led to the Angie’s Wiener’s tag line:”The Biggest Wieners and the Hottest Buns!”\r\n\r\nWith all the key components in place, Angie’s Wieners is taking on a life of its own. Starting with a food truck and capitalizing on the growing trend of gourmet mobile dining, she is soon to be seen all over Southern California and the rest of the nation if things go her way. She’s got big things on her mind besides just Wiener trucks. Be on the lookout as Angie’s Wiener Empire continues to grow.",

There they learned and reinvented the art of making tea-based beverages and cooking Taiwanese cuisine. Additionally, Frances has been exposed to the tea industry for over 15 years through her family. Both owners have a vast knowledge of Taiwanese street foods and the boba tea industry because of their own cultures and growing up tasting these items.\r\n\r\nThe Mighty Boba Truck offers main dishes, known as Mighty Heroes, featuring Buttermilk Popcorn Chicken, Island Pork Chop, Taiwanese Sweet Sausage, and Marinated Tofu Steak. In addition, we serve sides (namely Sidekicks) such as Sweet Butter Toast, Consensed Milk Toast, and Honey Sweet Potato Fries. We also invent Specials of the Month items to add to the variety of flavors.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, The Mighty Boba Truck delivers TASTE-omizable Mighty Concoctions, made-to-order tapioca Boba Tea beverages. Choose from Black Tea, Green Tea, several Milk Teas (Regular, Honey, Almond) and many Refreshing Teas (Passion Fruit, Honey, Mango), with or without sweet gummy boba balls. Yum…Special requests (less sugar/milk, etc) are welcome; if we can do it, we’ll do it. And just like our food selection, we introduce new Flavor of the Month to stimulate different taste buds. ^_^v",

The Cupcake truck stops Monday-Saturday, delivering our signature moist and flavorful minis throughout the Southern California area. Delivery/Catering also available for your next wedding, shower, or event!\r\n\r\nSugar Babies Cupcakery began to take form when co-owner Kassandra Workman discovered a hidden passion for confections and baking in 2006. A hit with friends and family, Kassandra was soon catering her famous macaroons to a local art gallery, making fondant-covered cakes for birthday parties, and crafting cookie bouquets for baby showers and other events. \r\n\r\nAfter moving to Los Angeles with sister and Sugar Babies Cupcakery co-owner, Rachel Crystal, the sisters quickly tired of the oversized, cookie-cutter desserts at local bakeries. Recognizing the need for a more reasonably-portioned, fun and flavorful treat, the signature mini cupcakes of Sugar Babies Cupcakery were born.\r\n\r\nThese days, they wake early each morning to craft their signature baby cupcakes, load them onto the cupcakery truck, and drive their creations all over the city for your enjoyment. Their hearts and hard work helped make their dream a reality, and with each Sugar Babies cupcake you purchase, you all help to keep it alive! So thank you, Sugar Babies customers, for your business and your continuing support of all things sweet.",

These days, as I sift, whisk and frost at the bakery I began with my husband in Beverly Hills, I imagine our scratch-based cupcakes as a natural extension of my great grandmother's legacy.\r\n\r\nAs we continue the tradition of simple and satisfying desserts handcrafted from the best ingredients – not too precious, always just right – our hope is that Sprinkles Cupcakes will conjure up lovely memories of your own childhood or family, or simply the pleasure of good taste.",

They make your soul glow with the unholy light and create sensations to the senses. But still they leave your stomach empty and sad. Take heed heshers: Grill 'Em All is here to fill the void that music and mayhem can not. Enter the realm of the burger.\r\n\r\nGrill 'Em All is steadfast in the belief that the heavy metal and culinary worlds were bound to collide one day in a victorious marriage of massive meat and riffage. Where better for this battle to commence than in the city of fallen angels? Los Angeles, your cries in the night have been answered. Cry no more!\r\n\r\nGrill 'Em All is led into the burger battle by the team of Chef Ryan Harkins and Matthew Chernus. The two have been allies and band mates for over twenty years. Ryan has paid his dues as a veteran of professional kitchens for over a decade strong, having worked in Chicago, Los Angeles, St. Louis, Columbus and Cleveland, Ohio. The combination of his fine dining background and strong Midwestern roots has left him with the desire to place a gourmet take on his first love, the hamburger. Dare to stop him! Matthew, also beckoned as the Future of America, is an ex-professional wrestler and he owns a megaphone. Need I say more on his behalf? I dare not in fear of being Liger Bombed through a barbed wire board with black widows and broken forties of King Cobra beneath.\r\n\r\nTogether they are ready to turn the key, they are ready to hit the streets, and they are ready to... GRILL 'EM ALL!",

We pride ourselves in providing authentic Hawaiian style Shave Ice with highest quality ingredients and flavor. Our syrups are hand-made and our block of ice are carefully freeze daily.\r\n\r\nCommunity Events\r\n\r\nHaole Boys Shave Ice specializes in various community events; music, art, film and cultural festivals, carnivals, concerts, family events, sporting events, movie premiers and community celebrations. Our gourmet dessert truck is specifically designed to handle high attendance events.\r\n\r\nPrivate Catering\r\n\r\nHaole Boys Shave Ice has taken the classic Shave Ice stand off the Hawaiian beach and brings it to your front door, or business establishment, with a few modern twists. Whether you are looking for the great classic Hawaiian taste or wanting to mix it up with something a little more adventurous we have the Shave Ice for you.\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Us Different?\r\n\r\nAuthentic Hawaiian Shave Ice starts with top quality ingredients. We hand-make all of our syrups with pure Hawaiian cane sugar, NEVER high fructose corn syrup. Our blocks of ice are made daily with pure filtered water and frozen at a precise temperature to achieve a perfect shave. The ice blocks are hand shaved whenever possible to exactly the right consistency to create the best \"shave ice\". The fluffy snow must be packed down perfectly: too little and the soft ice will melt when the syrup is added turning to a slushy; too much and the flavor will not soak into the ice and sink to the bottom making a snow cone. We pride ourselves on having the best melt, a skill even seasoned shavers have difficulty perfecting!\r\n\r\nThe Melt\r\n\r\nThe Melt is the way the freshly shaven ice melts into your tongue. Shave ice is not crunchy like a snow cone with syrup at the bottom - every bite of delicious Hawaiian Style Shave Ice melts in your mouth and bursts with flavor. Our syrups are infused into the ice creating flavors designed to evaporate on your tongue and explode with flavor. It's all about the melt and Haole Boys Shave Ice has the best!",

The motto is simple... If you can't pronounce it they don't serve it.\r\n\r\nTo read more about Young's philosophies and the great dishes you might find on this truck, check out the Roaming Hunger blog here: http://roaminghunger.com/blog/7425/the-revolution-is-fresh",

But he soon realized that it’s about more than just amazing food (you can get that on any street corner in Los Angeles) -- Trailer Park Truck is a 24-hour traveling food party! Whether you're watching Beavis and Butthead or Dukes of Hazard while waiting to place your order or munching on the some of the best street food in LA while sitting on lawn chairs next to pink flamingos listening to 80’s hair bands, you’ll always leave Trailer Park Truck  saying, “Damn, that was fun! And dang tasty too!” And that's why we do it—for the love of great food and good fun! \r\n\r\nWelcome to the party…Trailer Park Truck has arrived.",

Besides our signature eggrolls, we also roll with some classic deli favorites such as sandwiches, sides and salads. You will want some MOE!\r\n\r\nHere's the scoop. For centuries, the Jews and the Chinese have loved each other's food. At the end of the 20th century, daring food explorers began to marry these two cuisines and create a provocative and modern fair called Jewnese. M.O.Eggrolls is the first gourmet food truck to bring this new flavor to Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nCrispy wrappers, toasted ends and overflowing filling makes a Montreal eggroll better than any other. Our eggrolls are rolled tightly around copious amounts of exotic fillings, leaving the ends open to become brown and toasty. The end bites are the most coveted bites of a Montreal eggroll!\r\n\r\nCombine equal parts seasonal, local and kosher ingredients, wrap in a fine eggroll skin and lightly fry to crispy crunchy deliciousness and you have a M.O.Eggroll. The menu is rooted in the traditions that Mom and Bubby taught, but is inspired by modern techniques, and the pursuit of super tasty grub. Bright and crisp accompaniments and house made dipping sauces cleanse the pallet between rich and succulent mouthfuls of eggroll. Wash it all down with an ice cold cup of organic iced tea. M.O.Eggrolls is kosher certified and supervised by Rabbi Susan Leider. Everything in our Los Angeles food truck is made with kosher and natural ingredients. The M.O.E. menu includes Michael's classic Montreal style chicken eggroll, along with seasonal favorites that will change regularly. Check back for updates each season, and surprise weekly specials from our gourmet food truck!",

The Bun Truck represents where we come from, and where we are today: The no-nonsense, gritty city of Detroit, where we're from, and the sunny, laid-back city of Los Angeles, which we've come to love. \r\n\r\nCome try any of our Spicy Pork Gyros, Donkatsu Steamed buns, and Sweet Potato Fries.

            "short_description": "Peruvian/Japanese food truck offering fusion street food.\r\n\r\nEric Nakata, a second generation Japanese American, was born and raised in Gardena, CA, the heart of Japanese restaurants. At the early age of 19, he worked for Men Bei, a Japanese restaurant in Torrance. He soon learned what the \"restaurant business\" was all about. Moving on to working for Kamiyama, he quickly learned how to make sushi. He then worked for Patina at the Hollywood bowl and then ventured to the Dodger Stadium where he introduced sushi to our beloved Dodgers team. Eric has been hired frequently to cater sushi for private parties, birthday parties, special events (including Eliza Dushku's birthday party), the Grammy's after-party, the Disney Concert Hall, as well as the LA Cathedral and Ritz Carlton. He managed to do all this while still working as an executive chef for Kotosh in Lomita for seven years. There he developed a network of admirers who kept coming back for more. \r\n\r\nHe was able to save up enough money to begin his dream of becoming the owner of a mobile restaurant where he can share his unique Peruvian and Japanese fusion of cullinary creations. With the support of his family, friends, admirers, combined with his inspirational ideas, Eric is now the owner of Lomo Arigato. The name says it all! It combines \"lomo\" which is the first part of his main dish called \"lomo saltado\" with \"domo arigato\" which means \"thank you\" in Japanese. Being a pioneer at heart, with his humble, fun loving, and light hearted personality along with his passion for food, Eric Nakata is living his dream at the young age of 27. He's ecstatic to be able to give everyone a taste of his creations, so he hopes you'll all be around to have a try and see how it is yourself!",

            "short_description": "Del's Los Angeles is bringing Rhode Island's famous Del's soft frozen Italian fruit ice to southern California. Del's fruit ice is made from a secret recipe of filtered water, fruit and sugar. This proven recipe consistently produces a high quality, delicious product.\r\n\r\nDel's Lemonade is a time honored and family tradition. Starting in 1840 Italy, great grandfather DeLucia stored snow in caves during the winter insulating it with straw. In the summer months when the lemons are ripe DeLucia would mix the juices from the lemons with the right amount of snow and sugar to create a wonderful and refreshing drink.\r\n\r\nGreat Grandfather DeLucia made the earliest Del's Frozen Lemonade in 1840, in Naples, Italy. During the winter he carried snow into nearby caves and insulated it with straw. When summer arrived and the local lemons were ripe and flavorful, he mixed their juice with just the right amount of sugar and snow. Thus making a refreshing drink, which he sold at the local market. Fruit ices are popular in Europe, yet none is more loved than the product made from fresh lemon juice. Lemon ices produce the most delicious and thirst-quenching treat.\r\n\r\nGrandfather Franco DeLucia brought his father's frozen lemonade recipe to America at the turn of the century. Angelo DeLucia, his son, began work on a machine to produce the frozen lemonade, and on a method of making it a consistently excellent product. In 1948, Del's Frozen Lemonade acquired it's name and became the sole product sold at a little stand in Cranston, Rhode Island. Soon, Angelo had designed the first mobile units in order to serve anywhere in the state.\r\n\r\nWhen Angelo's son, Bruce, entered the family business there were 5 franchises in Rhode Island. Since then, Bruce has made the franchise business flourish and grow. Now, there are many Del's franchises worldwide providing the refreshing, all natural treat to everyone, anywhere, anytime.\r\nBruce's daughter, Stephanie is now in the family business. She is president of Del's Lemonade's sister company, Francesca Enterprises International. Stephanie also works directly with web sales, promotions and marketing.",

Armed with a video camera and an endless supply of frozen treats, he was determined to become not only the most famous ice cream man in Ashland, but the most famous ice cream man in the world. As that summer came to a close, Allen’s mission of entertainment evolved into a greater calling. He began giving away his ice cream for free, starting with an ice cream social for the residents of Ashland and quickly moving to his hometown of Long Beach, California to expand the simple idea of free ice cream into the phenomenon it is today.",

We have taken our most popular family recipes and given them an edgy and innovative twist for the road. \r\n\r\nMany ask, why Hungry Nomad? Our truck is a traveling nomad without a permanent home, migrating from one location to another with a primary focus of feeding the people. Our truck is also a representation of us as Californians. Our original cuisine is the product of a mix of cultures and flavors that tells the story of our family and how California influenced our palate to create this fusion .",

If you are from the East Coast, your eyes are lighting up as italian ice was your favorite summer treat growing up in New York, Philadelphia, or any of the surrounding areas where italian ice has become the king of all desserts! You may have called it “water ice” back home…or “ice”…or “iceee”…or in our case, a “crush”.\r\n\r\nCalifornians, who are not familiar with italian ice, are always blown away with how silky smooth, flavorful, and refreshing our ices taste. We are told over and over again, that we are far superior to sno cones and shave ice as our italian ices are dairy-free and made with fresh fruit puree, pure cane sugar, and filtered water. We also make sugar-free flavors using Splenda as the sugar substitute. We make our ices in the same machine that makes ice cream – freezing the ingredients while mixing them together. No more watching sticky syrups poured all over chunk or shaved ice which consists mostly of air anyway and ending up with a puddle of liquid at the bottom and crunching on non-flavored ice on top.\r\nWe look forward to serving you your 1st Crush!\r\n\r\nFrozen Crush can make your upcoming event or party the talk of the town with our Crush Cart. Not only do we make our ice fresh in-house, we can help you choose the best flavors and combos for your specific event. Whether you are planing a birthday party, office or corporate event, tv/movie set refreshment, bar or bat mitzvah, or school party – Frozen Crush would love to be there.",

What began as a dream was brought to life by passion, dedication and creativity, and has unfolded into an amazing company we're proud of. Fueled by decades of friendship, fresh ingredients & the flavors we love, Nonna's Kitchenette (grandma's little kitchen) was born!\r\n \r\nWe're re-inventing Italian food. 100% homemde. With love. Using ONLY the best ingredients. We’ve put a modern twist on nonna’s homemade classic dishes and created unique menu items inspired by flavors we love most. So here we are... best friends, waking up every morning doing something we’ve always loved, together. We're so grateful to be sharing it with the world and thankful for everyone who has become a part of the Nonna’s family. No one ever leaves hungry in our families so, Mangia Mangia! Join us as we take our inner foodies on the road on Food Network's \" GREAT FOOD TRUCK RACE, SEASON 3\". Tune in Sundays at 9pm. We hope to see you all real soon!\r\n \r\nTo our friends, family and each and everyone of you who continue to support us, THANK YOU.\r\nXo <3 Lisa, Jessica & Jaclyn",

We are firm believers (and our track record proves it too!) that a juice a day will keep your mind, body, skin and soul strong and focused. We know what you're thinking: where are your cleanses? To be frank, cleanses can help the body shed a few pounds in a short time span but is extremely detrimental to your body (we'll explain why below) in the long run.\r\n\r\nBenefits of Daily Juice Extraction\r\n\r\nLets face it. Our bodies would love us to instantly consume 6 carrots, 1 tomato, 1 whole celery heart, a few apples, lemons, and a cucumber but it is impossible to do so without feeling ill from the overexertion it takes to break down all the nutrients. This is where Juice on the Loose comes in to break down the fruits and vegetables for you and allows your body to instantly absorb 100% of the nutrients, vitamins, minerals and enzymes. Maximum gain with no pain. Mix the juice in with a balanced diet of protein, carbohydrates and healthy fats and your body will stay in tip-top shape.\r\n\r\nHaving one of our juices daily will:\r\n- Promote Anti-Aging\r\n- Alleviate Symptoms of \r\n- Fight Disease\r\n- Increase Metabolic Rate and Fat Burn\r\n- Enhance Immunity\r\n- Prevent Cancer\r\n- Stimulate Weight Loss\r\n- Beautify skin tone\r\n- Unclog pores\r\n- Fortify hair, nails, teeth\r\n- Regenerate cells\r\n- Suppress Appetite\r\n- Detoxify blood and remove impurities\r\n- Increase energy and uplift mood\r\n\r\nWhy Cleanses (Unfortunately) Aren't Good For You:\r\n\r\nA huge misconception when it comes to \"juice cleanses\" and \"detoxes\" is that your mindset needs to be set on ridding everything in your body. That is definitely not the case, as the most important thing in life is maintaining balance and fortifying your daily diet with the health benefits from juice. Typically, a person will not consume adequate calories during a juice fast, causing them to put their body at risk for being in ketosis (starvation mode). Another downfall is that most people discontinue juicing post-cleanse and revert to old habits. With cleanses, it eradicates all of the daily nutrients and fuel one would usually receive from consuming proteins, grains and healthy fats and adequate amounts of fruit and vegetable juice.\r\n\r\nEffects of Completing a Juice Cleanse:\r\n\r\nQuick fix to weight loss as one loses mainly water weight\r\nSevere calorie restriction causes body to go into starvation -mode AKA ketosis\r\nLeads to long-term detriments such as organ failure, kidney stones, dehydration and gout\r\nCauses headache, fatigue, exhaustion, body odor and bad breath\r\nPromotes acid reflux due to lack of protein and high acidic concentration\r\nDisrupts metabolic rate and encourages nutrient deficiencies\r\nExcessive water and vitamin-rich juices gleaned during a cleanse provides short term skin glow but long term premature wrinkles\r\nEuphoria experienced during juice cleanse may be a sign that the body thinks it is starving and is trying to prevent suffering\r\nWithout sufficient protein the body turns to muscle for fuel, slowing metabolism and promotes long-term weight gain",

            "short_description": "The Buttermilk Truck brings homemade breakfast favorites to the streets of Los Angeles using our key ingredient, BUTTERMILK, in almost all our menu items. Buttermilk provides you the most important meal of the day, catering to those who are too busy to make breakfast and those craving breakfast after a long “fun” night. Buttermilk Truck takes pride in making our Buttermilk biscuits and assorted breakfast pastries from scratch and baked daily. Our Buttermilk pancake, waffle and donut batters are also all made from scratch and cooked to order. WE at Buttermilk truck LOVE breakfast and we want to share it with you!\r\n\r\nMy favorite meal of the day is breakfast. I can eat breakfast morning, noon, and night.  Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, yet the one that is most often skipped due to our crazy morning schedules.  I wanted to be able to provide homemade diner breakfast favorites to morning rushers and for those last night cravings.\r\n\r\nOwner/Founder — Gigi Pascua\r\n\r\nI graduated from LMU with a BA in Business Administration and shortly after went to culinary school in NYC at The French Culinary Institute for Pastry Arts. I’ve interned at Nobu NYC and worked as the pastry chef at Bin 8945. I combined my business skills with my love for food especially breakfast and created Buttermilk, Inc.\r\n\r\nKlippy’s lifestyle and love for the most important meal of the day has won him the “Buttermilk Boy” honor.  Klippy is your “typical” 10 year boy, born and raised in Seattle, Washington. Klippy cannot wait to wake up every morning to the smell of bacon and eggs cooking on the stovetop. He sneaks some bacon in his pocket for a mid day snack. He secretly feeds his English bulldog, Sparky, breakfast links with maple syrup.\r\n\r\nButtermilk Boy –  Klippy\r\n\r\nKlippy’s claim to fame is Junior Champion Buttermilk Pancake Contest Winner with a whopping record time: 25 pancakes in 5 minutes. He washed it all down with his signature drink: milk and maple syrup. Whenever Klippy comes to Los Angeles to visit his sister, an aspiring actress, he makes sure she brings him to The Buttermilk Truck. Be sure to catch Klippy’s happy cheerful roaming face around LA.",

He recently moved to Los Angeles after being turned on to the food truck craze that has been going on, and decided to bring a east coast favorite to sunny California and hopefully beyond.\r\n\r\nSeeing the exiting  food truck movement going on and wanting to make a BIG splash, he decided to stick with the east coast size and offer a humongous sandwich that is served with your choice of meats, provolone cheese, tomatoes, Italian coleslaw, and finally stuffed with fresh cut fries.\r\n\r\nSo you can say it’s the best bang for the buck, so far in the industry. They also have half size portions for those who would like to try the beautiful tastes but don’t have the room for the big potatoes.\r\n\r\nFries are the hottest selling item, with a choice of Chef Andres’ special home made dipping sauces.",

The Koyama family came up with their own version of fry bread tacos.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, while living and working in Los Angeles, we had a hankering for fry bread tacos that could not be satisfied.\r\n\r\nGrowing up in Montana, fry bread tacos were a comfort food that we all loved (and still do). They are a Native American meal, often found at pow-wows and other festivities. So why is it not found in most major cities? In Los Angeles, we could not locate a single place to purchase a fry bread taco. We decided it was time to take the family recipe and share it with the big city folk. Thus, Auntie’s Fry Bread was born.",

The Pineapple Express truck will be found at locations throughout Los Angeles offering breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late-night eats.\r\n\r\n“I’m delighted to bring the dishes of Hawaii to the Mainland with the delicious, bright flavors we taste daily on the islands,” says Choy. “From my poke, to our special ‘da kine’ sauce, all the way to our Sweet Endings, we’re definitely going to give you more hula for your moolah.” \r\n\r\nPineapple Express is dedicated to a conscious approach to cooking true Hawaiian heritage cuisine, with a dedication to using hormone-free and grass-fed meats, sustainable seafood, and locally grown produce wherever possible. In line with Chef Choy’s culinary philosophy, Pineapple Express will offer guests authentic interpretations of Island cuisine, priced $X-XX. Honoring one of Hawaii’s most beloved fish preparations—poke—Choy serves it in wraps, a “Big Island Bowl,” and as poke sliders, poke parfait, or “Hokie Poke.” Additional standout dishes from the menu include Sam’s Original Kahula Pork Sandwich, rubbed with Haeila sea salt, wrapped in tea and banana leaves, slow-cooked for 12-hours, and served on King’s Hawaiian sweet rolls with Pineapple Express marmalade; “Maui Wowie” Chopped Salad with Napa cabbage, bok choy, romaine, red cabbage, carrots, bell peppers, edamame, and candied Macadamia nuts with choice of protein; and “More Hula For Your Moola” Wraps with brown or “Sam’s island-style firecracker rice,” choice of kalua pork, beef, marinated chicken, crispy fish, poke, or “magic” mushrooms, and topped with tropical fruit salsa and “Da Best Sauce.” \r\n\r\nConceptualized by Choy and Operating Partner Chef Jeffrey Mora, Pineapple Express will feature design aesthetics evoking feelings of tropical surroundings. Bright beach colors, tribal motifs, and of course, a pineapple adorned on the truck, create a laid-back atmosphere reminiscent of the Island way-of-life. In addition to the truck, Pineapple Express will cater and produce large parties, luaus, and events from an off-site kitchen, complete with traditional pig roasts, hula dancers, ukulele players, and more. \r\n\r\nChef Sam Choy is known as a founding contributor of “Pacific-Rim cuisine.” With over thirty years perfecting his craft, Choy owns multiple restaurants across the Hawaiian Islands; has hosted his own cooking show, “Sam Choy’s Kitchen”; founded the Poke Festival and Recipe Contest in 1991; and in 2004 was awarded the James Beard Foundation Award for Best Pacific Regional Chef. \r\n\r\nChef Jeffrey Mora has worked in over 20 countries and has been involved in all aspects of the food service industry, including tenure as the chef for the Los Angeles Lakers from 2004 to 2011; a member of the U.S. Culinary Olympic Team in 1992 and 1996; and head of food service for Burbank Airport. “I’m thrilled to be working alongside Sam on this project,” remarked Mora. “We’ve been friends for many years, and I’m looking forward to connecting with my fellow Angelenos to spread his passion and introduce L.A. to the flavors and history of Hawaiian cuisine and culture.”\r\n\r\nPineapple Express will frequent areas throughout Southern California, Monday to Saturday, offering breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late-night eats. Fans are encouraged to follow Pineapple Express on Twitter and Facebook. Menus and additional information are also available at www.samchoypx.com.

Get Angelenos to taste Indian-style street fare at a low price and served in true “desi” style – eating casually curbside.\r\n\r\nSo, we got a bright-orange gourmet food truck, threw a few “no tomatoes” on it and have started this new sensation in Indian street fare.\r\n\r\nNow we’re serving delicious kathi rolls, chapli burgers, biryani, mango lassi, sometimes with a twist, and an ever-changing “Just generally” daily special. Our promise to you is to serve fresh and healthy food like whole wheat wraps and brown rice, at street dining prices and always with a smile. So, come on down when you see the orange truck, taste our food and give us your feedback if you want and just generally have fun! But remember, no tomatoes!\r\n\r\nOh, and why “No Tomatoes!”? Because one of us doesn’t like tomatoes and always orders food with “no tomatoes” – keep following us to see if that changes!",

Being of Vietnamese descent, going home meant being surrounded by a wide array of mouthwatering Vietnamese food. One being Bánh Mì, which are Vietnamese sandwiches on fresh and crispy baguette. They were always a delicious treat with traditional flavors of lemongrass chicken and BBQ pork that were always succulent, but are an acquired taste that comes from our Vietnamese culture.\r\n\r\nThe taste buds we obtain from the beautiful and diverse city of L.A. longed for something else – something new yet reminiscent of the types of food that we grew to love from our neighborhood. We couldn’t resist the delectable taste of Mexican food, so why not fuse cultures together?\r\n\r\nLos Angeles is our place of birth. Saigon, Vietnam is our roots. The birth of LOS SAIGON combines the scrumptious Vietnamese Bánh Mì with an alluring twist of L.A. flavor.\r\n\r\nWith fascinating sandwiches like our signature CHINO LATINO, a unique and crispy Bánh Mì filled with succulent carne asada, our cuisine is just as charming as our fellow Angelenos! We want to share with every Angeleno our exciting cuisine, company and service!\r\n\r\nWe thank you in advance for supporting LOS SAIGON, and spreading the Bánh Mì love!",

The truck is the brain child of Frenchman Ludo Lefebvre. \r\n\r\nLudoBites is a restaurant by Chef Ludo Lefebvre that has no permanent address and no phone number. We like to say that the restaurant is limited only by Ludo’s imagination.  Many, including ourselves, have called it a “pop-up” restaurant and that may have been true for a while, but to truly characterize our business model as it exists today, we are a “touring” restaurant.  Like a club band we have been touring locally since 2007 and “playing” different parts of Los Angeles; West Hollywood, Culver City, Downtown, Sherman Oaks with more to come. \r\n \r\nLA Weekly’s Pulitzer Prize winning food critic, Jonathan Gold, has named a LudoBites dish as a Top 10 Dish of the Year for each of 2007, 2009, and 2010 and has called it a “Kitchen of a Genius.”  The Los Angeles Times, has said LudoBites “has L.A. on a Culinary String”; Sam Sifton of the NY Times declared, at LudoBites, “every plate is a fully realized piece of art”. Ruth Reichl announced that LudoBites is the “supremacy of food over ambience.” And Josh Ozerky of Time Magazine named Ludo, “The Chef of the Future.” \r\n \r\nAlthough Ludo’s restaurant has no permanent address, “wonders flow from his borrowed stoves.” “The restaurant is a figment of Ludo’s imagination. And if you’re luck, of yours too,” J. Gold. ",

After months of “research”, eating at all the top sandwich shops and observing in every kitchen he could get into, he came back to So. California with the magic formula for a great cheese steak sandwich and about 12 pounds and 2 inches.\r\n \r\nLeaning on his experience of owning a restaurant he decided to surf the wave of gourmet food trucks hitting the shores of So. Cal. knowing he could rip and curl with the best.\r\n \r\nSince February of 2010,  Lee’s Philly has been serving tasty traditional cheese steaks and fusion cheese steaks, tacos, and burritos in LA and OC.  Currently, Chef Chris is also serving “Surf & Turf” cheese steaks, the ever popular Bacon cheese steak, and Spicy Shrimp tacos and burritos.\r\n \r\nCome see why Lee’s Philly is LA & OC’s BEST Gogi!\r\n\r\nCheck out our weekly calendar to see where we’ll be for  lunch and dinner…better yet, follow us on Twitter and Facebook to receive up-to-date postings on our where abouts.",

            "short_description": "Inspiration. Passion. Humility. Innovative. Culture. These five words best describe the story, the life, and the personality that is: Get Toasted. Former Restaurant Manager John Yuhico and Chef Manuel Medina began working together in May, 2010. This was a partnership that was made to last.  Little did they know that after a year of grinding and working extra long hours in a restaurant, the two would collaborate and create a business filled with passion and culture. Their energetic and jubilant personalities create an atmosphere that is beyond a typical GFT (Gourmet Food Truck). They strongly believe that the world of food does not end with what is on your plate, but what story and experience you can take away from it. Both gentlemen traditionally grew up dining at the dinner table. It was then where conversations begin and stories are told that made the celebration of food come to life.\r\n\r\nChef Manuel and John took this tradition and carried it into the personality of the food truck. They bring their culture of Spanish, Mexican, Filipino, and Asian backgrounds and create an innovative fusion of flavors. Their take on classic sandwiches has married technique with essence and has rejuvenated sandwiches that most consider comfort food.\r\nJohn and Manuel express their gratitude to all of their supporters, friends, family and most importantly; God. “It is with great fortune to be able to live out our dream and be able to express our love and passion for food to all. We are extremely blessed and thankful for all that has been given to us and now is our chance to “pay it forward”.- John Y.\r\n\r\nAlways remember, “Live, Love, and Get Toasted!!!”",

            "short_description": "Fox Pizza Bus is a Los Angeles based, traveling wood-fired restaurant & catering company featuring organic, artisanal foods specializing in handcrafted pizzas.\r\n\r\nThe Fox Pizza Bus began as the dream of two young entrepreneurs to bring simple, quality food to the streets of Los Angeles on a mobile platform.  Starting in August 2008, Chef Mike Fox and event planner Jordan Hieshetter began focusing their efforts to seeking out the perfect mobile platform to do so.  That platform came into America by way of sea at Port Hueneme in July 2009.  What arrived was a bright yellow, Scottish transit double decker bus-complete with orange plaid interior. After a lengthy makeover and transformation, which included a custom-built commercial kitchen, the Fox Pizza Bus premiered during the summer of 2010 featuring the only mobile enclosed wood-burning oven in the country.  Back from hiatus, The Fox looks forward to partying with each and every one of you in 2012.\r\n\r\nOur Food\r\nAs always, we continue our dedication to local, organic and sustainably sourced ingredients.  It’s simple; the best ingredients make the best food.  We’re not snobs, we’re supportive of Southern California farmers & ranchers and encourage a seasonally focused menu.\r\n\r\nChef Mike Fox\r\nLoves: Fire & Spicy Bush Basil from Windrose Farms\r\nGrowing up in Los Angeles, this valley boy developed a taste for street food as a kid tagging along with his father to every hole-in-the-wall restaurant and stand in the area.  A chef from the very beginning, Fox earned his first Kitchen Aid Mixer for a 13th birthday present and began devoting his life to food.  After gaining his bachelor’s degree in Culinary Arts & Hospitality Management at Le Cordon Bleu Scottsdale Culinary Institute, Fox pursued his ambition of owning a small wood-fired pizzeria or taco truck serving a modernized take on food reminiscent of the many places he grew up visiting.  Taking his experience cooking in esteemed fine dining establishments in Santa Barbara & Scottsdale and work as a private chef and caterer, Fox brought his love of wood fired food to life in the Fox Pizza Bus.",

            "short_description": "The Frysmith truck serves fries that eat as a meal. How does that work, you ask? The scientific answer is: We throw stuff on top. Stuff like all-beef chili flavored with chocolate and beer or kimchi and heirloom pork under gooey cheddar cheese. It all gets piled on hand-cut Kennebec potatoes fried twice in canola oil (the only oil good enough to be named after Canada). The resulting fries are crispy and crunchy enough to stand up to whatever topping we throw on them!\r\n\r\n\r\nEthical Eating\r\nFrysmith is dedicated to using humanely raised ingredients. Free-range Jidori chicken and Kurobuta pork belly not only taste far better than factory-farmed meat, but they're also much more humane. We even use cage-free eggs to bake our cookies! Delivering top-notch ingredients at affordable prices may not make the most business sense, but it's the ethical choice we make every day.\r\n\r\nIn addition to caring about the food we make we also pay attention to how we serve it. On Frysmith, you'll find biodegradable forks, craft sodas in easy-to-recycle glass bottles and not a plastic straw in sight! We even reuse our fry oil to run the truck's engine!\r\n\r\nThe Frysmiths \r\nFries with enough toppings to eat as a meal resulted from the stuck-in-traffic daydreaming of Erik Cho. The SoCal native grew up in the flavorscape of Los Angeles with its tacos, burgers, shawarmas and kimchis. The flavors reveal themselves in Frysmith's menu and the specials Erik creates every week. Erik's wife Brook Howell jumped on board to handle the business end of the Frysmith, bake fun yet extravagant cookies, and careen the truck around the streets of Los Angeles. ",

Our menu is pretty traditional right now, but we'll be looking to expand our offerings and be a bit more creative moving forward.  \r\n \r\nStory:  \r\nThe whole idea for Nom Nom Truck came about due to the appalling lack of Vietnamese Sandwiches on the Westside of Los Angeles.  A self-proclaimed  \"Banh Mi\" fanatic, Nom Nom co-founder David Stankunas would often drive great lengths to San Gabriel, Alhambra, and Westminster to procure a decent Vietnamese sandwich.  It was a difficult existence for David, suffering through Los Angeles traffic for hours at a time, just for a bite of a soft, chewy, crunchy, salty, sweet and savory delicious Banh Mi.  But then a savior arrived in the form of a scrappy little taco truck called Kogi BBQ.  Kogi (now infamous and considered a revolutionary in the mobile food truck world) gave David the idea to open his own mobile food truck, but instead of serving Korean BBQ tacos (which are fantastic, btw), he would serve Banh Mi!  No longer would David, nor any Westsider, have to trudge through LA traffic for the culinary masterpiece that is the Banh Mi.  Banh Mi has finally come to West LA! \r\n \r\nAfter coming to the revelation that Banh Mi could be served from a mobile food truck, David quickly recruited a team of super awesome partners who would help make his dream come true.  Misa Chien and Jennifer Green, who David first met through UCLA's Hapa Club (\"hapa\" means \"part asian.\"  David is half-Vietnamese, Jenn is half-Vietnamese, and Misa is half-Chinese), soon joined the quest to start a Banh Mi mobile food business, and thus Nom Nom Truck was born!",

            "short_description": "We are a Phamily owned and operated business focused on bringing the Vietnamese comfort food we grew up on to your neighborhood via our mobile food truck.\r\n\r\nThe head chef and driving force behind Phamish Food Truck is none other than the matriarch of the Phamish “Phamily” – Lisa “Mama Love” Le. She was born in Nha Trang Vietnam and came to the states in 1975 when Saigon fell, with her two sons and extended family (sisters, brothers, and mother). “Phamish” is actually named in memory of our grandma (Lisa’s mom) Du Thi Pham who passed away in late 2007.\r\n\r\nMama Love has always been an entrepreneur at heart. She and her ex-husband owned a small asian market in Pomona that was bought out by Hoa Binh Supermarket in the early 80′s. She and her sisters opened up one of the first nail salons in West LA, Fancy Nails,  in the early 80s that branched out to other cities such as Rowland Heights (Fancy Nails & Nails 2000), Whittier (Fancy Nails), Dallas (Nails 2000) and Chicago (Vogue Nails). In addition to operating the nails salons she has also co-owned several furniture stores in LA & La Habra (Lu’s Furniture) and Rowland Heights (Vopel’s) with her ex-husband and brother-in laws. She also owned a restaurant in Pomona for a short period of time.\r\n\r\nMama Love has always been known for her home cooking. Her food has always been the unifying element for our “phamily” & friends during the holidays and special occasions. During those times she would invite family, friends, friends of her sons and employees over for an authentic vietnamese meal cooked with love for hours that left a warm feeling in our stomach and hearts, hence her nickname “Mama Love.” She has not been formally trained other than cooking for her kids, family and friends. The food on the Phamish menu is the same food she cooks for her “phamily” at home.\r\n\r\nIn June 2009, After more than 20 years in the Nail Salon industry, Mama Love decided to sell her Nail Salon business in Chicago and relocate back to Southern California to be closer to her sons and her newborn grandchild. Never one able to sit still, she was contemplating what to do with herself when one of her nieces told her about the food truck craze that was occurring in LA. She discussed the idea with her sons and nephew and after a bit of research decided to jump head first into the food truck craze. Mama Love has always been a woman of action and in under two months she launched Phamish with her two sons, daughter-in-law and nephew in December 2009. Her son Khai Lu who also owns the Tutti Frutti yogurt shop in Marina Del Rey is the General Manager. He is also a programmer and co-owns the development firm JhaiChrispy. Her other son Hac Le who resides in San Francisco and runs his own design company, IDK Design, created the Phamish brand and it’s online presence. He is the Brand & Online Marketing Director. Her daughter-in-law Liz Lu and nephew Van Vo assists with Public Relations and Office Administrations. At any given time you can find anyone of us on the truck servicing our clientele.\r\n\r\nWe also do catering! Let our Phamily bring our delicious and healthy Vietnamese home cooking to your next event, corporate lunch, or party. In addition to our regular menu of mouth watering Pho, Banh Mi, and Phammy Snacks, we can also create a tantalizing custom menu for your event. ",

            "short_description": "Due to their success in both Los Angeles and Jacksonville, this badass burger truck is finally coming to the streets of Orange County!\r\n\r\nBaby’s Badass Burgers sprang from the imaginations and experiences of ex-New Yorker restaurateur Erica Cohen (pictured right) and celebrated event planner Lori Barbera (pictured left). Cohen launched her career in the restaurant world as one of the founding partners in the first of The ONE Group’s many restaurants. Cohen, a passionate foodie and burgermeister at heart who had “been searching for the perfect, quintessential cheeseburger since [she] was a little girl,” decided that in order to satiate her quest she would have to create her own flawless burger: the Simple Original Beauty on the BBB menu.\r\n\r\nFor her part, Barbera, who has produced dozens of events for celebrities from Lauren Conrad to Common, companies from Comedy Central to Paramount, and shows from Dancing with the Stars to Big Love, is applying her considerable event and catering expertise directly to the launch of BBB. She is already creating a buzz with potential customers from all over the entertainment industry who wish to enliven their lunch and dinnertime offerings. Together, the dynamic duo of Cohen and Barbera originated the Baby’s Badass Burger concept, design and branding, and developed and refined the menu with Executive Chef Jason Ryczek.\r\n\r\n“It’s been fascinating to witness the trend over the last decade of the gourmet burger being added to many high-end restaurant menus, and even more fascinating to appreciate consumers didn’t blink at an exorbitant $15+ price point,” Cohen explains. “Now, with the recession, that consumer perception around value is reversing course. Baby’s Badass Burgers, which strips out the hard costs of a traditional restaurant, allows us to deliver greater value at a fraction of the cost, more conveniently, without compromising restaurant-level quality. It’s a win-win-win from studio heads to college students to late night revelers looking to satisfy their gourmet burger craving.”\r\n\r\nSo the next time you see a glimpse of a hot pink flash rolling by you — it just might be Baby’s Badass Burgers coming to a street near you.",

There he introduced the empanada to his restaurant patrons in Praia do Forte, then a nascent eco-resort favored by vacationing Brazilians and Europeans.\r\n\r\nDuring his twelve years in Bahia, Piaggio perfected the meat grilling techniques that are his trademark and he incorporated the Afro-Brazilian cooking styles and tastes of the area into his evolving cuisine.\r\n\r\nThe empanada comes to California…\r\n\r\nThe empanada followed Piaggio to California where it was the star of his Laguna Beach eatery and then the mainstay item in his subsequent Argentine and Brazilian steakhouses. \r\n\r\nHow it all evolved into a taco truck…\r\n\r\nChef Piaggio thrives in fusing his Argentine roots with the food culture of his adopted land. With Piaggio Gaucho on Wheels, he has taken the main taste sensations from Argentina, combined them with his expertise in cooking meats, and then blended all with the taco culture of California.\r\n\r\nThe result is that Piaggio on Wheels is delighting fans with his chimichurri fusion.\r\n\r\nWhat’s in store for the future…\r\n\r\nThe hardworking Piaggio on Wheels trucks will be covering Orange County, LA County and San Bernardino County for lunch and dinner, special events, and private functions.\r\n\r\nYou can always find Piaggio on board, living his motto: At your service!",

First, we are the original authentic Hawaiian Shave Ice in Southern California since 2004 and love what we do and are a family business. We finely shaving a BLOCK of ice, not crushed ice cubes and adding our own homemade tasty fruit flavors. It has to be fluffy and creamy! It's a tropical creation and should be as soft as a cloud. It can only be made by finely shaving ice only from a BLOCK of ice right in front of you if you see an ice cube (or they call it shaveD ice it's not real and tell them we said so!), topped with delicious colorful fruit flavors made from Pure Cane Sugar with no high fructose corn syrups or preservatives! If you like try it \"local\" style served over a scoop of vanilla or Macadamia Nut ice cream or with a snow cap on the top and Li Hing powder! \r\n\r\nIf you’ve never had a REAL Shave Ice, believe us this is not a snow cone and it will be the hit of the party, we even make an adult version! It’s creamy and melts in your mouth like a gelato. Just take a bite, close your eyes and the feel sensation of the warm trade winds, see the Tikis, warm tropical waters, lush green mountains, waterfalls and the spirit of Aloha! Then open your eyes and take another bite of your Hula Girls Shave Ice!\r\n\r\nHula Girls Shave Ice covers Orange County, Los Angeles and San Diego counties and has successfully catered events for top companies, concerts and schools. We would love to help you affordably celebrate your next birthday, luau, event. We are Orange County's largest most authentic Hawaiian Shave Ice company.",

We pride ourselves in providing authentic Hawaiian style Shave Ice with highest quality ingredients and flavor. Our syrups are hand-made and our block of ice are carefully freeze daily.\r\n\r\nCommunity Events\r\n\r\nHaole Boys Shave Ice specializes in various community events; music, art, film and cultural festivals, carnivals, concerts, family events, sporting events, movie premiers and community celebrations.  Our gourmet dessert truck is specifically designed to handle high attendance events.\r\n\r\nPrivate Catering\r\n\r\nHaole Boys Shave Ice has taken the classic Shave Ice stand off the Hawaiian beach and brings it to your front door, or business establishment, with a few modern twists. Whether you are looking for the great classic Hawaiian taste or wanting to mix it up with something a little more adventurous we have the Shave Ice for you.\r\n\r\nWhat Makes Us Different?\r\n\r\nAuthentic Hawaiian Shave Ice starts with top quality ingredients. We hand-make all of our syrups with pure Hawaiian cane sugar, NEVER high fructose corn syrup. Our blocks of ice are made daily with pure filtered water and frozen at a precise temperature to achieve a perfect shave. The ice blocks are hand shaved whenever possible to exactly the right consistency to create the best \"shave ice\". The fluffy snow must be packed down perfectly: too little and the soft ice will melt when the syrup is added turning to a slushy; too much and the flavor will not soak into the ice and sink to the bottom making a snow cone. We pride ourselves on having the best melt, a skill even seasoned shavers have difficulty perfecting!\r\n\r\nThe Melt\r\n\r\nThe Melt is the way the freshly shaven ice melts into your tongue. Shave ice is not crunchy like a snow cone with syrup at the bottom - every bite of delicious Hawaiian Style Shave Ice melts in your mouth and bursts with flavor. Our syrups are infused into the ice creating flavors designed to evaporate on your tongue and explode with flavor. It's all about the melt and Haole Boys Shave Ice has the best!",

We do not use processed or frozen products in any of our food preparations.\r\n\r\nWe also conduct routine inspections and use strict quality control measures within our own facility and with our suppliers to ensure that production is carried out with the best practices possible to deliver optimum quality every time.\r\n\r\nWe have a large selection of meats to choose from and all of our Veal, Lamb, Angus and Beef are specially selected from the most valuable and tender cuts. All of those cuts are then marinated for 18 hours in a temperature controlled environment prior to preparation. Due to our passion for perfection, we guarantee to serve only the tastiest Köfte (Regular and Cheesy Meatballs) , Döner (Gyro), Beef Sausage (Sujuk), and Shish Kebab which are proprietary to our food trucks.\r\n\r\nAt buqqa , our menu is prepared daily and all of our locally sourced meats are seasoned with traditional Mediterranean hand prepared spice blends imported from Turkey and Italy. Putting a modern spin on an ancient process, we utilize a Döner (Gyro) grill which is a vertical rotisserie that turns and cooks meat evenly while the grease is allowed to drip and be captured below.\r\n\r\nCatering Service\r\n\r\nMediterranean culture is famous for large gatherings with 50-200 guests for  birthdays, graduations, engagements, weddings, etc. We have a carefully crafted catering menu that begins with delectable appetizers like Tabboula, Hummus and more. Then we move to delicious and tender main dishes, and follow up with a variety of scrumptious Mediterranean sweets.\r\n\r\nOur extensive catering service  is perfect for large and small gatherings. Please consider us for birthdays, weddings and engagements, fund-raisers and charity events, and more!\r\n\r\nWe will WOW the crowd with our food and make your event an unforgettable one!",

Our goal is to provide a top quality menu from American classics to chef inspired street food, featuring our very popular Mango Salsa. Our food is all natural, organic, and of course delicious!\r\n\r\nLook for us roaming the streets of O.C. and all the best Foodie events in Southern California!\r\n\r\nChef and owner of the Eat ‘Em Up truck, Eddie Alvarez, has always had a huge passion for food. After attending the Le Courdon Bleu School of Culinary Arts he worked as an executive chef, personal chef, lead cook, and he also worked for Wolfgang Puck Catering. Before starting the Eat ‘Em Up Truck he ran another truck for a major catering company.\r\n\r\nAt this point he then decided to take on new projects in New Orleans and then Miami. When finding out his beautiful girlfriend and partner Genevie Watson was pregnant with his son Elijah Edward Alvarez it was at that time that they decided to start on their current project, the Eat ‘Em Up truck! Stay tuned for more new and exciting projects from Eddie and Gen!",

We style your typical boring quesadillas with meats, and veggies, and various cheeses.  We even serve sweeter quesadillas for our divas with a sweet tooth.  We also accessorize them with different salsas and sauces just to give a bigger wow factor.  What's a Quesadilla (or what we like to call them a QuesaDiva) without its entourage (sides)?  Our sides are just as good as our quesadillas but they never steal the spotlight.  They do have their moment to shine, however.  Sides include: Fried Zucchini Coins, Chips, Onion Strings, and much more. ",

Packing his knife bag, he attended the world famous French Culinary institute in New York.  \r\n\r\nHe learned from masters like Jacques Pepin, Andrea Soultnor and Jacques Torres, and cooked with Rocco Despirito and other New York chefs. Prior to starting his own catering company in Newport Beach, he worked for the famous catering company, Tentation Catering, in Manhattan.  After returning to Orange County, Ted joined Patina Croup's catering operation as a chef.\r\n\r\nWith this exposure to preparing food, the Flavor Rush Food Truck menu will vary and change on Flavor Rush on a weekly basis.  One week there maybe scallops and abalone and next week there could be lentil soup and a croissant stuff with cheese and tomato served with fries and a hint of French truffle.",

We are serving up Kobe beef burgers made with Tillimook white cheddar on locally made fresh brioche and in house made garlic aioli. We are using free range chicken wings and drums for our diablo & angel wings. Our Ribs come from happy pigs and 90% of our food is organic. It's all the flavor and half the guilt.

Why can’t there be a truck where people want to hang out at? One that has good entertainment to go along with the delicious food. One that has the interaction and atmosphere that can only be found in restaurants and sports bars.\r\n\r\nWell we’re here to change that. We’re the Tailgate Truck, and we’re here to provide you with a full interactive food truck experience.\r\n\r\nABOUT OUR TRUCK\r\n\r\nImagine hot grills sizzling with homemade burgers, the sound french fries crisping in the fryer, satellite TV tuned into the latest sports and entertainment programming and music playing through a customized sound system.  Now, imagine all of that outfitted on a four-wheeled ride cruising the Southern California streets. Our entertaining crew serves homemade food out of our customized red and orange mobile eatery.\r\n\r\nWe have a vision to provide customers with a unique food truck experience that delivers everything we love about tailgating – cool people, great entertainment, and most importantly, quality food.  Our classic comfort food with a slight twist is prepared with the freshest ingredients and sustainable products direct from our local farmers, meat suppliers, and bakeries.  We also offer crave-worthy vegetarian, dairy-free and low-fat menu items that can satisfy even the staunchest carnivore.\r\n\r\nExperience the Tailgate Truck for lunch or dinner.  We’re open six days a week, and for us, everyday is game day.  To find out where we’ll be next, follow us on Twitter or check back on our website for the weekly schedule.\r\n\r\nCome tailgate with us!",

Founding brothers Andrew and Alex Honoré, along with Andrew’s wife Mary, are the owners, energy, and creative genius behind Shortstop BBQ—a product that is so much more than “good.” It is our hope and our mission to bring you delicious “dirty” BBQ with a clean, California appeal. Andrew and Alex have collectively served over a dozen years in the restaurant industry, always driven by passions for great food and fantastic service. Looking for ways to become better at their trade, the boys came up with the idea to start their own business, and after months of conceptualizing, experimenting, and planning, Shortstop BBQ opened its doors as a catering company in February 2010. We believe in real food for real people, and that is our promise to you.",

Christiana worked in her family's financial business before deciding to follow her passion for baking full time. As a young child she remembers watching her mother bake delectable desserts from scratch for Sunday dinners. Christiana utilizes the skill baking from scratch from her mother and has incorporated gourmet, organic and all natural ingredients along with artisan techniques to her mouth watering recipes.  \r\n\r\nIn 2007 Suite 106 Cupcakery became the first cupcake-only business in the Inland Empire and one of the first in Southern California. They started out as a small cupcake catering company, catering events and weddings throughout Southern California. They also shared space and sold their cupcakes at 2 different retail locations within the Inland Empire, this is when they started to grow a name for themselves in the community. Later Suite 106 Cupcakery branched out to sell their cupcakes online where they delivered and shipped their goods nationwide.\r\n\r\nToday Suite 106 Cupcakery Won the first season of the Food Networks hit Series Cupcake Wars and has also competed in Cupcake Wars season three \"Battle Of The Champs\". Since season one of the show Suite 106 Cupcakery has gone on to open a storefront of their own in Rancho Cucamonga California located in the Beautiful Victoria Gardens and has launched The First Gourmet Cupcake Truck in the Inland Empire which is currently roaming the streets of Southern California. The gourmet cupcake truck has already gotten tons of notice winning the first I.E. Food Truck Fest in Ontario California with the 2011 Sweetest Treat Award. Christiana and her sister Rebecca are also Winners of the November 2011 Spirit Awards for Entrepreneur of the year in the Small Business Catergory for the Inland Empire region of Southern California one of the largest areas in the United States. \r\nSuite 106 Cupcakery has plans to expand their business and open their second location and launch their second gourmet cupcake truck very soon.\r\n\r\nChristiana along with her sister Rebecca Grammer-Ybarra, parents Harry and Lee Grammer, fiancé Jason Jones, daughter Monae and the whole Suite team have all made Suite 106 Cupcakery what it is today.",

After high school, she turned her passion into a profession by graduating from Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts as a Pastry Chef. Though busy working in several bakeries, many people still requested custom cakes by Naomi. She was often told “You need your own shop!” Her dream was to have her own shop, but she didn’t want to do custom cakes; she wanted to make cupcakes! At 26 years old, however, she just didn’t have the means to do it alone; but, her biggest fan, her mom, believed in her dream, and so opening a shop became Melinda’s dream too. Having run the administration side of a church for over 20 years, Melinda knew a thing or two about managing, and took on the role of CEO. After many trials and obstacles, on Dec. 5th 2009, My Delight Cupcakery opened their doors to a line of enthusiasts, becoming one of the IE’s first cupcake-only bakeries.\r\n\r\nMelinda and Naomi are dedicated to excellence, and desire to delight each customer with friendly service, superior flavor, and beautiful design.",

            "short_description": "To some, a cheeseburger is just a slab of meat on a bun, but to us...it's a work of art. A great burger is simple yet sublime - the delicate tastes melding into, yet never overpowering, one another. We (my wonderful and adorable wife and I) are what you might call \"Burger Connoisseurs\".\r\n\r\nAnd because of our deeply held burger beliefs, we here at The Burger Bus are 1000% committed to bringing you the best burger with the freshest toppings you have ever tasted any time, every time.\r\n\r\nBUILDING YOUR BURGER\r\n\r\nFor the patties, we keep it simple, because that's the key to serving delicious, mouth-watering burgers. That's why we insist on the exact amount of seasoning: just enough to emphasize the naturally beefy taste of fresh, cooked meat, brought to you exclusively by Shalhoob Meat Company. All of the meat served at The Burger Bus is 100% grass fed, hormone free beef. (Please check out www.eatwild.com for more information.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Our Daily Bread of Santa Barbara, we offer a freshly-baked ciabatta roll, light and pillowy on the inside with a delicate yet crispy texture on the outside. It's the perfect bread choice for our signature \"CB&J\" (Cheeseburger and Jelly) and it will go beautifully with any of our other burgers.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's not forget the cheese. Direct from Spring Hill Cheese via the Santa Barbara Farmers Market, we serve a big, fat hunk of gooey cheddar, pesto jack, or a spicy slab of Mike's Firehouse jack so full of chilies it actually bites back. Since we are working with a small artisan cheese maker, our cheese options will change through out the year.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the finishing touches, we serve only farm-fresh toppings from The Berry Man, featuring sweet grilled onions, red ripe tomato, leafy green lettuce, and crunchy pickle chips. To top it off, we add a dollop of mayonnaise and a smear of yellow mustard.\r\n\r\nRINGS OR CHIPS?\r\n\r\nNot to be outdone, each of our amazing sides, including fresh-cut yam fries, hand-dipped, Telegraph beer battered onion rings, and deep-fried pickle chips, are a delicious complement to any of our burger options or alone for a quick, easy, yummy snack.\r\n\r\nVEGETARIAN'S DELIGHT\r\n\r\nFor those of you who prefer an alternative to meat, we've perfected a falafel recipe that's simply amazing. We start with fresh garbanzo beans, toss in a delicious blend of herbs and spices, separate the mix into bite-size pieces, then deep fry each one to a crispy golden brown. For added flavor, a spicy, creamy peanut sauce accompanies these scrumptious little bites.\r\n\r\nFEEL FULL, NOT GUILTY\r\n\r\nAs much as we believe in making the best food possible, we also strive to be an environmentally-conscious mobile burger restaurant. That's why this Burger Bus is a retired, retro-fitted school bus. What's more, all of our paper products as well as the occasional plastic cup are recyclable. \r\n\r\nTired of reading? Hungry for a really good burger? Then order up!\r\n\r\nWe look forward to serving you soon,\r\n\r\nCheryl & Michael",

We truly care about this kind of food, and we hope to share that love with our community.\r\n\r\nSee you on the street…\r\n\r\nWe make it our mission to thoughtfully source ingredients that are produced by local farmers and artisans who share our love of food. It is without a doubt that an ingredient such as Point Reyes Bleu Cheese, which we are featuring on our Bloody Mary Burger, is exceptionally delicious because its producers are truly passionate about its quality and craftsmanship.\r\n\r\nA few years back, I got to visit the Giacomini’s farm in Point Reyes Station, CA, and I was amazed at what a great operation it was. Their product, Point Reyes Bleu Cheese, is a farmstead cheese, meaning every step in the production process occurs on the farm’s property. Milking begins in the wee hours of the morning and is then pumped into the cheese production facility next door. There, penicillium Roqueforti (the mold that creates the blue streaks) is added to the milk, along with natural enzymes and salt to create the cheese we know and love.\r\n\r\nIf you ever get up to the Bay Area, I strongly urge all of you HOMI’s out there to get out to the farm to visit the Giacomini’s. You’ll be treated to a wonderful view of Tomales Bay, but best of all, you’ll get to meet a producer who truly does it for the love of the food.",

We know the feeling. It is that desire to try a little bit of everything that inspired the concept behind The InSlider.\r\n\r\nDriven by variety, our first steps were to ask for input from the community on an assortment of topics from our name to colors for the truck. We then united a team with diverse experience in culinary, business and creative ventures. After much anticipation, and months spent developing the menu/preparing the truck – TheInslider hit the streets in March 2012. We’ve been serving up gourmet sliders and fries all over San Diego ever since.\r\n\r\nCommunity, sharing, variety, and a love for unique, tasty food have inspired us to embark on this culinary adventure.

Nana's Heavenly Hot Dog's decided the tradition was fading and wanted to keep it going, while adding the flare of a new decade to it. Thus Nana's Heavenly Dog's was born.\r\n\r\nOur vision became a reality when the economy went south and job security went out the door. Being long term entrepreneurs Nana's Heavenly Hot Dog's scraped up the money to get their first hot dog cart. The road to success was not easy, or even paved, as we had read. Yet with success as the only option we focused on the enjoyed the journey. We wanted to be a company that not only had happy customers but gave back. \r\n\r\nWe rolled the dice and took a gamble. Sure everyone thinks the profit margins are huge on hot dogs, however, when you offer a quality product and your giving away a huge part of the profit margins are very small. Yet we knew we were offering the best product at a great value, and we actually listened to our customers, and did so with a smile.\r\n\r\nNana's Heavenly Hot Dog's built this business on three things. \r\n1. Customers and their interaction, and feedback.\r\n2. Value, after all if you get good service that doesn't fit your budget, is it good value? If you get service and value you'll share.\r\n3. Cleanliness. We know, We know. Cleanliness as number 3? Well first of all most  businesses that serve food neglect to even have this on their list, and if they do it's for fear of the health inspector. We are certain 98%+ of our customers would never refer their friends and family to us if we ran anything but a top notch business.",

            "short_description": "We are Bob Montgomery & June Sinclair and we are, Not So Fast! here in sunny San Diego, California. We have both worked in the restaurant industry for over 14 years. Bob has worked all over the country for many popular establishments, while June has been bartending and serving from San Francisco to San Diego over the past 8 years.\r\n\r\nWe are passionate about people, crazy about food, and we're packing a fresh take on food-on-the-go into a 4 wheeled street sensation. Everything served at Not So Fast! from the sauces to the patties are made from scratch with all locally sourced and carefully selected products...and a dash of love.\r\n\r\nBoth of us have always been relatively selective and food conscious. Bob struggled with weight issues in the past, and had spent years trying diets that would allow him to maintain a healthy weight and to feel good. We started following the Primal Blueprint lifestyle after Bob stumbled upon a few articles that resonated with his thoughts on how people should and can eat. The changes we've experienced since have been out of this world. Not only are we leaning out and getting in shape; the foods that we prepare and eat every day have made us the healthiest we've ever been. Close friends who have followed the lifestyle continue to offer great support and direction. We spend countless hours reading articles and material from Mark Sisson, Robb Wolf, Gary Taubes, Chris Kresser, Diane Sanfilippo, Dallas & Melissa Hartwig and many more.\r\n\r\nWe push each other to learn more about this healthy lifestyle every day, which in return has helped us discover more about ourselves.",

Pizza made with passion.\r\n\r\nI call myself a conditional pizza lover.  I’ve had enough to know most don’t leave much reason to return.  However, I can tell you when a pizza is made from a professional who really attaches passion to the pie you can taste the difference.  It becomes an experience you’ll never forget and no matter how far you traveled - this yearning will send you on your way again.\r\n\r\nThis happened to me in Naples 7 years ago.  Upon returning to California I spent the next 2 years searching for a similar experience.  Finally, I turned to my own hands and a modified home oven.  I spent the next 4 years perfecting recipe after internet recipe in search of the perfect dough.    \r\n\r\nIt finally came to me, recipes are mechanical and scientific - what I needed was feel the dough, becoming emotionally connected.  After all the dough is alive.  I threw away the measuring cups and recipes and simply went on feel. \r\n\r\nLooking back, the pizza I ate in Naples was great but the experience was so memorable because of the inspired passion found in a Genuine, Pizzaiolo.  These are people who have dedicated their lives to basically making 3 pizzas all of which are light on toppings.  Marinara, Margherita, and Margherita Extra.  The desire to perfect such simple recipes was my handle and I grabbed on to it.  \r\n\r\nI fell in love with the idea of the simplicity and beauty from a really well made pizza.  \r\n\r\nIt's the dough. We focus on old world tradition and technique. My dough is completely hand crafted using no mechanical mixers. We pride ourselves in delivering the highest quality ingredients period. Organic Giustos Flour, San Marzano's, Parmigiano Reggiano, EVOO, and Fior di Latte. Completely mobile Mugnaini Italian Made Wood Fired Oven.",

            "short_description": "ta·be (tah-bay)\r\nA formal Japanese word meaning \"to eat.\"\r\nFor as long as he can remember, owning his own restaurant has been Chef Todd Ichinaga's dream. Following his heart, he left his pharmaceutical career behind to study hospitality and restaurant management at the California School of Culinary Arts, where he quickly fell in love with the intricate art of food preparation. Chef Todd's talent and drive to succeed earned the attention of not only his professors, but the owners of some of Los Angeles' best restaurants as well. Immediately after graduating among the top of his class, he accepted a position with the world-famous, five-star/five-diamond Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills.\r\n\r\nChef Todd worked to perfect his craft at the Peninsula, preparing acclaimed dishes for celebrities, high-powered businessmen and other members of the Los Angeles elite. While many would consider preparing dishes for musicians, celebrities, and royalty to be the high point in their career, Chef Todd continued to work toward his dream of opening his own restaurant. He began experimenting with combinations of flavors inspired by cultures around the world, and over time, created the cuisine that would come to be known as Tabe.\r\n\r\nOur unique cuisine blends Asian-inspired dishes with a classic Mexican flair to create one of the most unique flavor experiences in San Diego. Such unique food required a unique dining experience; therefore, instead of San Diego coming to Tabe, we decided to bring Tabe to San Diego. By specializing in what we lovingly refer to as Mobile Cuisine, we are able to bring our irresistible tacos and burritos to San Diego's hottest locations.\r\n\r\nSo when you see a Tabe truck, make sure to stop by. Whether you try our classic tacos or Chef Todd's latest creation, we promise you'll be back for more!\r\n\r\nTabe - we are San Diego's Premiere Mobile Cuisine!",

After taking classes with Famous Italian Pizzaiolo, Renown Sonoma Chefs and World Champion Pizza Aficionados, Dr Kriders’ love for food blossomed in August 2011 to start Where’s The Fire. \r\n\r\nOur commit to quality has driven us to source fresh ingredients from all over the world…we handcraft our pies with buttery Grande cheese, authentic Caputo 00 flour, ripe San Marzano  tomatoes and  savory Turkish Oregano, just to list a few. The romantic tradition of the wood-fired oven brings flavor forward unlike any other oven.  The blazing fire and wood elevates anything we bake for a fresh out-of-the-oven culinary experience.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to bask in the glowing flame and scent of wood for a taste explosion to amaze your senses…at our events or yours.",

Homemade, handmade, from scratch: no matter how you say it, that’s what we do to make a better sandwich. Presenting New York on Rye, the best deli food west of NYC. We make our own mustards, dressings, horseradish, and fries. No store-bought coleslaw for you! We’ve sourced the best locally available meats, cheeses, vegetables and fruits, because your taste buds deserve nothing less.\r\n\r\nEver wonder why folks from “Back East” get misty-eyed thinking about their favorite pastrami? You need a terrific navel: beef navel. It has the best marbling for the trials and tribulations of becoming great pastrami. Lots of delis try to pass off other cuts of beef done “pastrami style”, like brisket, or (heaven forbid), top round. After a relaxing two-week bath in special brine, pastrami is hung to dry for another day, slow smoked, and if you’re lucky, steamed to tender perfection. It can be sublime. Just like grandma did it back in the old country.\r\n\r\nWe’ve given the same consideration to each ingredient and every recipe we offer. We’re foodies. We love to eat good food. But we prefer great food. So we’ll only bring you a great deli experience. That’s how we roll. We’re roaming the streets and office plazas of San Diego’s north county every weekday\r\n\r\nIt’s in the cure. It’s in the smoke. It’s in the meat. That’s only at New York On Rye.",

Try their signature Mother Trucker vegan veggie burger, add an heirloom beet salad and an organic fresh-squeezed lemonade and you’ve got their “Happy Trucker Meal”. But for all you pescatarians and carnivores, don’t worry they’ve got you covered. The free-range chicken pesto wrap or wahoo fish tacos will sustainably satisfy your taste buds.",

            "short_description": "Kate Murray born in California, November of 1984, grew up in small town in the Inland Empire called Rancho Cucamonga where she attended grades K-12.\r\n\r\nAlong with being an avid and competitive soccer player, Kate has always been the entrepreneur. She spent many weekends selling ‘made to order’ snow cones in front of her family’s home and quickly started employing neighborhood kids to help out with the work load. Her mother would often come home after work to an impromptu bake sale, art show or even a variety show, all organized by her then 8 year old daughter.\r\n\r\nKate’s teenage years didn’t go as well. She fell in and out of depression, developed an eating disorder and became generally unhappy. Kate lost weight, her appetite, ambition, motivation and over all zest for life. Then, a friend talked Kate into trying sushi.\r\n\r\nIn the months to come Kate became a regular sushi eater. She couldn’t believe that something could be so delicious and not make you feel sleepy, heavy or funky… like the Big Mac tends do to.\r\n\r\nOn a trip to LAX from San Diego, Kate saw a random banner in Los Angeles for the ‘California Sushi Academy’. That’s when the wheels started to turn. Kate had the phone number saved in her cell phone for almost a year before she called. Little did she know it would change her life, forever.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about Kate’s journey through sushi school as the main character in the critically acclaimed novel, ‘The Story of Sushi’ by, Trevor Corson. Available at all major book stores. Read this book and begin your journey to becoming a sushi pro!’\r\n\r\nKate is based out of San Diego, rolling daily.

            "short_description": "Shaved Ice has been around for many years, with its origins in Asia. The cool treat spread to Hawaii where it soon became a favorite.\r\n\r\nHawaiians originally would shave the ice by hand creating a cold flaky snow and topping it with fresh fruit juices.\r\n\r\nShaved ice is much different than a sno-cone in that it is made by a counter-top machine that shaves ice rather than grinding it like a sno-cone machine. This process  results in ice so fine that it rivals real snow! The snow is then placed in a cup and filled with high quality tropical flavors. Because the snow is so soft, the syrup is held within it's tender texture versus settling to the bottome like a traditional sno-cone.\r\n\r\nHawaiian Shaved IIce offers the most popular flavors throughout the USA.\r\n\r\nLi Hing Mui \r\n\r\nLi Hing Mui is a salty dried plum. It was made popular in Hawaii by Yee Sheong, who in early 1900 had began importing Li hing mui and other preserved fruits from China to Hawaii. It can be found in Hawaiian and Asian Markets. It has a strong distinctive flavor and is often said to be an acquired taste. It also has been described as tart and even tangy. Originally from China, the name li hing mui means \"travelling plum\".\r\n\"Li hing \" is \"travelling\" and \"mui\" is \"plum\"\r\n\r\nTry LiHing Mui as a topping to your  next shaved ice at no additional cost.",

            "short_description": "POP's philly cheesesteaks are not just close to the real thing, they are the real thing. POP's special orders all of its high quality cheesesteak ingredients including rolls, meat, cheeses, everything except fresh produce, directly from the City of Brotherly Love; Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOP’s is an acronym for Pride of Philly Steaks. Shortly after we opened, our customers began calling us “POP’s Philly Steaks” or just “POP’s.” That’s fine with us, because POP’s is an easy to remember short name for you to get the BEST cheesesteak anywhere!!\r\n\r\nOur mouth watering cheesesteaks are made at 501 S. Decatur Blvd. in Las Vegas, Nevada (on the Southeast corner of Alta and Decatur). It’s our only location, and we're certain this is one of the things that makes our sandwiches special, ensuring constant quality control and superb customer satisfaction; you can’t find another POP’s anywhere else!\r\n\r\nThe distinctive POP’s A-frame building was actually built in 1964 by a franchisee for Weiner Schnitzel. It later became Weenie Bender which was subsequently changed to an A&W Root Beer. Then in 1993 it became a cheesesteak restaurant.\r\n\r\nPOP’s acquired the restaurant in July 2002. Since then, we have been operating 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. We have made it our goal to never close the doors or the order window at POP’s, enabling you to always be able to satisfy your cheesesteak craving.\r\n\r\nOur customers love us because we serve a wonderfully delicious, sumptuous cheesesteak sandwich that is so authentically reminiscent of the sandwiches served in the greater Philadelphia area of Pennsylvania. Philadelphia is where the Philly cheesesteak was born in the early 1930s.\r\n\r\nProudly, one area where POP’s distinguishes itself is in its customer service. We strive to serve not only a great tasting sandwich, but a great looking sandwich as well. Our employees take great pride in their jobs. We give our employees a lot of freedom to make customer service decisions. Every sandwhich is customized to the customer's preference. Our grill masters are encouraged that any error made in estimating the quantity of meat on your sandwhich be on the side of too much rather than too little.\r\n\r\nOur customers love us because we serve a great product, at a fair price, by a friendly, courteous, and professional staff.\r\n\r\nWe deliver locally, orders of 50 sandwiches or more. We offer large order discounts. Those, you need to inquire about. They can range up to 25% off the regular retail price depending on the quantity you need, something to keep in mind if you have a large function or a large group of cheesesteak hungry folks with big appetites.\r\n\r\nA number of automobile dealers order from our stores on Saturdays for their luncheons. They may order 100 or 200 sandwiches. Typically, we prepare a variety of cheesesteaks enabling them to dress them after they arrive. What we mean by dressing is garnishing with mushrooms, onions, peppers, hot peppers, etc. after they arrive at the location where they are to be served.\r\n\r\nFinally, just because you don't see it on the menu doesn't mean we can't make it for you. Please ask, and if we have the ingredients, we will do our best to make it just the way you like it.",

We have only been baking as a team for a short time, but as a team we have created some of the most extrodinary tasting cupcakes your taste buds will ever come across.\r\n \r\nThe majority of our recipes where founded by one of our bakers grandmother. Her nickname came from her son-in-law Edward, who would call her Foxxy Lady, when he wanted her to bake him a special treat. Upon her passing, she bestowed several of her recipes onto her grandson, who then began to bake for his family and friends who adored the confections. The grandson, Chef Slade, then began to implement a plan with a team of great minds.  With the team pushing Slade to perfect his baking to a commercial level, Foxxy Lady's Cupcakes was formed.\r\n\r\nBoth Slade and his team of supporters, Chef Tee, Cheryl J., DiAngelo P, Monique & Shantel,  and a great plan to deliver cupcakes through-out the Valley, with their innovative mobile cupcake truck; they can now bring the great pastry taste of the South, to the taste buds of the West Coast.",

At Dolce Sicilia, we are passionate about quality, and believe that it all starts with prime\r\ningredients, which are hand crafted to perfection following our family recipes to create confectionery\r\nproducts that will surely captivate your taste buds.

They do it all over the world and we aim to do the same here in the Bay Area!\r\n\r\nThink of us as a moving restaurant that serves freshly made wholesome food in a bowl. We promise to fill you up with affordable options that offer a distinctly Chinese & California character to it.\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t matter if you’ve never eaten a rice bowl before or you are someone that eats rice every day, we are here to further the fact that 'street' food can also mean delicious and affordable foods together.\r\n\r\nWe hope that we have something that’ll fit your tastes. If we don’t, talk to us and we’ll do what we can to fix it! That's what MoBowl is all about. Our hope is that we will create food that you can afford, appreciate, and share with your loved ones.",

            "short_description": "Rice Rockit started as a crazy dream among friends early in 2011. We’re all foodies, and a few of our families have owned restaurants for many years. And with this huge movement of food on wheels sweeping the nation, we really wanted to be a part of it! It’s such a great avenue to showcase really good food. In the past, opening a restaurant was so expensive, risky, time consuming, convoluted, tedious, stress inducing, and you were lucky to make it past a year. But with this new movement, its no longer location, location, location – it’s about FOOD! If you cook it well and make it taste great, they will come… and better yet we can drive it to them! So we sobered up a bit and we got serious about our venture. We knew we wanted to be original and creative not with just our name, theme, and truck – but most importantly with our food. Growing up in Silicon Valley, we had the privilege of being in a wonderfully diverse community surrounded by great restaurants with flavors from all over the world. We wanted to take our favorite dishes, the food that we grew up with, and put a slight spin on it to make it fun, new, and exciting. So Fast Furios Fusion!\r\n\r\nSo how did we come up with the theme?\r\n\r\nWe wanted to be different, and light-hearted about the whole experience. Food should be fun and that’s the direction we took. We asked ourselves, what would be outrageous and what hasn’t been done before? Well we all grew up in the 90′s when import racing was just getting started. So we decided to incorporate that somehow with our business, and that really put us on the import racing direction.\r\n\r\nHow did you come up with the name, Rice Rockit?\r\n\r\nSo first off, we know the spelling is not the correct way to spell rocket. LOL So let us explain. When we went with the import racing theme, we wanted a cool and clever name. So who hasn’t heard of the term Rice Rocket? We all love rice…and on top of that one of us has been a DJ for over a decade, so we wanted to incorporate music with the theme. Hence forth, and therefore – in summary – We came up with Rice RockIt. Oh yeah BTW we love Star Wars too, so that was a plus. =)\r\n\r\nWhat in the world did you guys do to the truck?\r\n\r\nWe pulled out all the stops in getting the truck the way we wanted it. We took the extra time (months and months) to redo it almost from scratch. So imagine, Xzibit stealing our Honda Civic and say “Yo dawg, I heard you like to cook – so I’m putting a full kitchen into your ride, with a crazy sound system and crazy lighting.” That’s pretty much what we did. And with the help of our friends from Audio Design and (Marty’s Chop Shop) – we overhauled our little old truck into what it is today.\r\n\r\nWho are you guys?\r\n\r\nWe’re just a group of guys who always get drunk at a neighborhood bar and love food. We’re an Engineer, a Chef, Business Owners, and a DJ. It’s a great Silicon Valley combo. With this combination we plan to deliver great food and sick beats for your diverse EATS!!",

Jaime, a future law school student with some time off, and her husband Caleb, a physicist-trained software engineer in Silicon Valley, started TBG as a fun summer project. She cooks, he eats (and then cleans. Nothing is for free!). \r\n\r\nThe Butterscotch Girl offers a very simple product: butterscotch pudding. Made with only a few natural, preservative-free ingredients, it’s prepared and packaged with love in a (health department licensed) local kitchen. She also offers an exotic Orange-Cardamom butterscotch pudding, inspired by one of her favorite chefs, Donia Bijan (author of Maman’s Homesick Pie), and the Chocolate Mocha Experience, a decadent chocolate pudding. \r\nRight now, with the convoluted San Francisco and Santa Clara County permit regulations, \r\n\r\nThe Butterscotch Girl is staying in San Mateo County. Maybe when she gets mutant powers that enlarges her brain activity to understand all of it, she’ll tackle that mess. Or, you know, if enough people in SF want her to come that way. She understands how far a 20 minute drive is down to the Bay Area.",
